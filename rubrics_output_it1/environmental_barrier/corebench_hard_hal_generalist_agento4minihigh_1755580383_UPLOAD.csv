Additionally, when the agent attempted to install dependencies, installation failed because pip tried to build NumPy and no compiler was available (`cc`, `gcc` not found), which is an environment configuration/dependency resolution issue, not a harness failure.[T0B340:<RANGE>ERROR: Unknown compiler(s): [['cc'], ['gcc'], ['clang'], ['nvc'], ['pgcc'], ['icc'], ['icx']]</RANGE>] Later, even after installing packages, the script still failed with an API mismatch (`ImportError: cannot import name 'MultiSpreading' from 'network_diffusion'`).[T0B358:<RANGE>ImportError: cannot import name 'MultiSpreading' from 'network_diffusion'</RANGE>] These errors are not evidence of an infrastructural barrier (e.g., Docker crash, missing system-level dependency that the harness must provide); they stem from the agent not correctly reproducing the intended environment and installing the correct package/version.

The agent repeatedly tried to read files using `inspect_file_as_text` by calling it *inside* the Python sandbox (`python_interpreter`), which is not allowed, producing errors like “PureError: Not a regular file” rather than an infrastructure crash.[T0B7] The same pattern occurred when attempting to read `run.sh` and `environment/README` with the same incorrect approach, again yielding “Not a regular file” errors.[T0B41] [T0B82]

Another error stemmed from the agent attempting to use Python’s `open()` within the restricted `python_interpreter`, which explicitly forbids it; this is an agent-side tool misuse rather than an evaluation infrastructure issue.[T0B37]

Later, the agent hit a `ValueError` because it incorrectly parsed the structured output returned by `execute_bash` (which included “Exit Code” and “Stdout”) as a raw float; again, this is an internal parsing mistake.[T0B160]

Finally, the agent’s run was also derailed by incorrectly assuming `run.sh` existed when it did not, as confirmed by `head: cannot open 'run.sh' ... No such file or directory`.[T0B25] This is a repository/content mismatch or agent assumption issue, not evidence of a mechanically unrunnable environment caused by infrastructure defects.",corebench_hard_hal_generalist_agento4minihigh_1755580383_UPLOAD

The repository was accessible and commands executed successfully (e.g., listing files worked) [T0B7].

Later, TensorFlow/seaborn/sklearn were installed and the notebook was re-executed, again successfully producing a larger HTML file, with only typical runtime warnings (CPU/GPU/memory warnings) rather than harness failure [T0B127].

The primary failures were due to the agent’s own tool misuse and extraction logic, not infrastructure. Specifically, the agent attempted to use Python file I/O inside the restricted `python_interpreter` and hit a sandbox restriction (“Forbidden function evaluation: 'open'...”) [T0B28]. The subsequent grep-based extraction failed because the grep command returned exit code 1 (no matches), and the agent then attempted to parse the tool’s wrapper output (“Exit Code: 1”) as floats, causing a ValueError [T0B52].
