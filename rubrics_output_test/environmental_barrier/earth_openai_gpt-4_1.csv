capsule-0921079,environmental_barrier,0.00,0,"The agent was able to run the R script successfully after modifying the path to the required Excel file. The initial failure was due to the script looking for the file at a relative path that did not exist, but this was resolved by changing the path in the script. The transcript shows that the agent successfully installed the necessary packages and created the required Excel file. The lack of output in the results directory is due to the absence of any computation or output code in the R script itself, not due to an environmental barrier. Therefore, the failure to produce results is attributed to the script's content rather than an impassable infrastructure issue.",earth_openai_gpt-4_1
capsule-2708693,environmental_barrier,1.00,0,"The agent faced an environmental barrier due to the Conda Terms of Service (ToS) blocking the installation of necessary packages. The error 'CondaToSNonInteractiveError: Terms of Service have not been accepted for the following channels' indicates that the agent could not proceed with the required installations to run the R script or render the PDF. This barrier is impassable regardless of the agent's skill or alternative methods, as the infrastructure itself prevents any agent from accepting the ToS in a non-interactive mode. Therefore, this is classified as an environmental barrier.",earth_openai_gpt-4_1
capsule-1394704,environmental_barrier,1.00,0,"The agent encountered a CondaToSNonInteractiveError indicating that the Terms of Service for the required channels had not been accepted. This is a true environmental barrier because it prevents any agent from installing the necessary R packages or dependencies required to run the analysis. The error message explicitly states that the installation cannot proceed until the Terms of Service are accepted, which is a condition that no agent can bypass without the appropriate permissions. Therefore, the inability to install the required packages constitutes an impassable barrier.",earth_openai_gpt-4_1
capsule-1624349,environmental_barrier,1.00,0,"The agent faced multiple environmental barriers that prevented successful execution of the task. Specifically, the inability to use the 'os' module and the restriction on file operations limited the agent's ability to create necessary files and directories, install dependencies, and execute the Jupyter notebook. The error messages indicate that the agent could not perform essential operations due to these restrictions, which are true barriers that no agent could overcome regardless of skill or approach. Therefore, the failure to execute the notebook and obtain the required results is classified as an environmental barrier.",earth_openai_gpt-4_1
capsule-2345790,environmental_barrier,0.00,0,"The agent encountered a series of missing R packages while attempting to render the Rmd files. Specifically, the agent failed to render 'Study1-encoding_analyses.Rmd' due to the absence of the 'readr' package. However, the agent could have successfully installed the required packages using conda with the appropriate flags to accept the Terms of Service. The failure was not due to an environmental barrier but rather a lack of proactive package management by the agent. The agent could have anticipated the need for additional packages and installed them before attempting to render the Rmd files.",earth_openai_gpt-4_1
