Why I doubt this is an IFE: The evidence is not irrefutable that the benchmark is defective. The reported error (“Forbidden function evaluation: 'simps'…”) sounds like a sandbox/tooling restriction in that particular run, not a provable contradiction in the task itself. Even if `simps` were restricted, the task does not *require* Simpson’s rule; numerical integration can be done via `np.trapz` or manual quadrature. That makes this, at most, an agent-choice incompatibility, not an impossible or contradictory benchmark requirement. Also, 3/4 evaluations attribute failures to agent formatting/parsing issues and explicitly state the task is well-formed; there’s no cross-run confirmation that *any correct solution* would be rejected.

Alternative explanations: (1) The agent failed to include the import in the final snippet (or the harness only permits certain imports/functions and the agent didn’t comply). (2) The environment allows SciPy but the agent invoked a name (`simps`) not present due to missing import in the submitted code. (3) The “dependency block” shown may be illustrative, but the submission rules could still require the agent to include needed imports.

Final determination: Not overwhelming evidence of a benchmark defect that no capable agent could overcome. The task remains solvable; failures are plausibly agent-side (formatting and/or choice of disallowed function)."

Why this is not irrefutable IFE: None of these are shown to make the task impossible or to cause the scoring failures. Two independent runs are marked correct/success despite the truncation and ambiguity, which is strong evidence a capable agent can choose an interpretation consistent with the grader. The failures that are documented are clearly attributable to agent behavior (missing code fences triggering regex parsing error; producing invalid/partial code; wrong output format), not to the benchmark rejecting a valid solution.

Alternative explanations: The truncated text is likely resolved by an implicit convention (positive integers, often starting at 1) that matches the hidden tests; duplicates likely expected one way and a careful agent can infer from examples/tests; import constraints are typical of these harnesses (imports provided globally, or imports inside function allowed) and do not prevent a correct solution—again corroborated by successful runs.

Final determination: There is some mild underspecification/inconsistency, but no overwhelming, concrete evidence of a benchmark/evaluation defect that would prevent correct solutions. Grade 0."

(2) Why I doubt it: This is not irrefutable. Many such benchmarks intentionally provide the allowed dependencies pre-imported in the execution environment (e.g., np, integrate, optimize already in globals), and the “don’t include imports” rule is consistent with that. The existence of a sanitizer that removes imports does not prove the runtime lacks these symbols; it often enforces a style constraint while the harness injects modules.

(3) Alternative explanations: The repeated concrete failures reported in Evaluations 1–2 are clear agent-side formatting/regex issues (missing ```python fences / stray numeric output). Evaluation 3 also shows the agent could adapt to the single-function/no-import constraint, suggesting the task is solvable. A sufficiently capable agent could include local imports inside the function as a workaround if needed (unless explicitly forbidden), or rely on injected globals.

(4) Final determination: There is no overwhelming, definitive evidence that the harness rejects all valid solutions or that required modules are unavailable at runtime. The strongest evidence available points to agent formatting mistakes rather than a benchmark defect. Therefore, no IFE is established."

Why this is not irrefutable: The name mismatches are minor and easily worked around by calling the actually-provided functions or defining wrappers; multiple evaluators explicitly note agents did work around them and produced plausible code. That strongly suggests solvability, not an impossible/contradictory benchmark. For the import issue, the evidence is speculative: we are not shown the actual grader environment (whether np/si are pre-injected), nor a concrete failure traceback (e.g., NameError: np not defined) attributable to the harness. Other evaluations indicate the code ran in-trace, and failures were due to agent formatting/tooling/state mistakes. Without a demonstrated harness rejection of a logically correct solution (or a proven impossibility), this does not meet the “overwhelming, irrefutable” standard for an IFE.

Alternative explanation: Agents likely failed due to formatting/parsing requirements, tool misuse, or not packaging code in the required single-function format with the expected names—agent-side issues. A sufficiently careful agent could align names, include imports where allowed (or rely on provided globals if the harness supplies them), and pass.

Final determination: There is reasonable doubt and no concrete proof of a benchmark defect that no agent could overcome, so grade 0."

(2) Why I doubt it constitutes an IFE: The only concrete, clearly evidenced defect in the prompt is the docstring shape mismatch—and it is explicitly corrected by an “IMPORTANT” note. That’s not an irrefutable benchmark defect; it’s a minor spec typo with an in-text fix. The stronger claims (construct_matrix returning None; imports being unavailable; FD being inherently broken) are not shown with irrefutable, task-level evidence that all valid solutions are rejected. In particular, “D=None injected later” could simply be a placeholder from a prior subtask/template that the agent is supposed to replace in its own function; without the actual harness showing it overrides the submission, it’s not proven. The import constraint is common in these benchmarks: the environment often pre-imports numpy/scipy; the fact that multiple runs failed due to missing ```python``` fences suggests the harness was functioning and strict about formatting, not necessarily broken on imports.

(3) Alternative explanations: The observed failures are readily explained by agent errors: missing required fenced code blocks (regex parsing errors) and/or incorrect FD implementation/boundary handling causing nonsensical values. A stronger agent could (a) follow the required output format, (b) implement a stable FD scheme consistent with the provided scaffold, and (c) adapt to pre-imported dependencies.

(4) Final determination: There is insufficient, non-speculative proof of a benchmark/evaluation defect that would prevent any capable agent from succeeding. Therefore, no IFE is established."

Why this is not irrefutable IFE evidence: None of these are shown to make the task impossible or to make correct solutions systematically rejected by the grader. Unit-description inconsistency is common in multi-step physics prompts but is not proof the hidden tests can’t be satisfied; a capable agent can pick the convention implied by the reference/expected outputs and implement accordingly. Likewise, “don’t include imports” vs relying on pre-imports is not proven contradictory—many harnesses do pre-import; the only concrete failures shown are the agent outputting without the required ```python``` fence and later referencing `sp` without ensuring it exists. Those are squarely agent-side formatting/implementation mistakes. The stateless-tool complaint is also not decisive: the tool explicitly states snippets must be self-contained, and agents can adapt by redefining needed items; it does not prevent producing the final required function code.

Alternative explanation: The benchmark is coherent enough for a careful agent to (1) always wrap answers in the required python fence, (2) avoid relying on `sp` by using `from scipy.constants import k as k_B` or assuming provided globals, and (3) follow the harness’s unit expectations consistently. No evaluation provides concrete evidence that a correct, well-formatted solution would be rejected.

Final determination: Failures are attributable to agent errors; the alleged formation issues are plausible but not proven to be intrinsic, unavoidable benchmark defects."

Why I’m not convinced: none of the provided evidence irrefutably shows that a correct submission is impossible under the benchmark’s actual rules. Disallowing certain imports is not inherently a benchmark defect; it just constrains solutions. A capable agent can import allowed modules inside the function (or avoid them) and ensure all required names (`np`, `fminbound`, `itertools`) are defined within the submitted function, which multiple evaluations indicate the agent *did not* do in the final submission (free-variable `fminbound`). That looks like packaging/formatting/namespace management error by the agent, not a provable harness contradiction.

Alternative explanations: (1) `scipy.optimize.fminbound` may be allowed if imported in-function; the agent simply omitted it at the end. (2) The harness may provide `np` globally but not `fminbound`; again fixable by in-function import or reimplementing bounded optimization. (3) The `itertools` error pertains to earlier helper code; the final graded target may not require it, or can import it locally.

Final determination: there are some confusing prompt notes and restrictive imports, but no overwhelming evidence that the task is intrinsically unsatisfiable or that the harness rejects all valid solutions. The observed failures are plausibly agent-caused (missing imports / wrong final packaging)."
12,0,0,3,scicode_honey_openai_gpt-4_1;scicode_honey_openai_o3_2025;scicode_honey_openai_o4-mini_2025-04-16_high,"Claimed issue: The Grade-1 evaluator alleges an intrinsic scaffold/state inconsistency where the benchmark swaps/loses the required `compute_Schrod_Hartree` definition (replaced by a placeholder `new_func(): pass`), breaking downstream dependencies. Another evaluator notes a harness restriction (“Forbidden function evaluation”) and inconsistent instructions about returning one function vs a full program.

Why I doubt it / why evidence is insufficient: None of the provided evidence irrefutably proves the evaluation harness *actually* calls a missing/mismatched symbol in a way no agent could overcome. In this benchmark style, the harness typically executes only the submitted snippet and/or directly evaluates the last-defined function; seeing `new_func` placeholders in intermediate prompts can reflect the interactive wrapper (which always names the submitted function `new_func`) rather than a true missing dependency in the underlying tests. The “Forbidden function evaluation: numerov” complaint also sounds consistent with a sandbox rule that the agent could satisfy by defining/importing `numerov` within the allowed snippet (i.e., not inherently impossible).

Alternative explanations consistent with agent failure: Evaluation 1 and 2 document clear agent-caused problems (missing ```python``` fences at the end, undefined `polyfit`/`polyval` instead of `np.polyfit`/`np.polyval`, missing imports, placeholders). Evaluation 2 specifically shows the harness accepting correctly fenced code earlier, implying the setup is workable and failures were formatting-related.

Final determination: There is plausible suspicion of scaffold misalignment, but not overwhelming, conclusive proof that the benchmark is intrinsically defective or impossible for a capable agent. Given reasonable doubt and documented agent-side errors, this does not meet the bar for an IFE."

Eval 1 also notes a minor dependency-whitelist inconsistency (`math` used in provided code despite only numpy/simpson allowed).

(2) Why I doubt it: The strongest claim (imports stripped -> `np` undefined) is not irrefutably a benchmark defect. Many such harnesses execute the returned function in an environment where `numpy` is pre-imported as `np`, or they prepend allowed imports automatically. The evidence provided does not show an actual `NameError` traceback—only that the emitted function lacked an explicit import. That’s insufficient to conclude the benchmark necessarily rejects all valid solutions.

(3) Alternative explanations: A capable agent could (a) avoid relying on `np` by using pure Python constructs for the few needed operations, (b) reference `numpy` via whatever name is guaranteed by the harness (often `numpy`), (c) ensure compliance with the requested code-fence/format, or (d) rely on the likely preloaded `np`. Additionally, two evaluations attribute failure primarily to agent formatting/wrong-function submission, which are clearly agent-side.

(4) Final determination: There is not overwhelming, concrete proof of an intrinsic benchmark/evaluation impossibility. The observed failures are plausibly (and in two runs explicitly) due to agent compliance/formatting mistakes, and the purported `np`-scoping issue is speculative without a demonstrated harness failure.
