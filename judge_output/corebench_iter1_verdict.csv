Multiple approaches were tried across models (rmarkdown_render, R execution, python execution, apt_install, conda_install), yet the core blocker remains: Rscript is missing and cannot be installed due to permission restrictions. The convergence of failures across models supports that this is not a reasoning/tool-choice miss but a shared infrastructure limitation."

Since at least some failures clearly come from incorrect handling of tool outputs and env vars, it is plausible a competent agent could succeed by extracting the actual path string and installing packages properly. The permission issue on `../results` may be real, but it is not shown to be universally unavoidable (e.g., wrong working directory could cause it), and the larger failure (missing R packages) is unrelated to that permission barrier."

Cross-model patterns: one model hit missing matplotlib / undefined cfg; another saw undefined ConvLSTM/LSTM; these are consistent with the notebook not executing required cells due to missing dependencies or earlier exceptions. None of the models show rubric-qualifying hard barriers like conda ToS lockout, permission denied on required paths, network restrictions, read-only FS, sandbox import prohibition with no workaround, or missing system headers preventing unavoidable compilation. Thus, the cross-model evidence points to a shared capability/strategy gap (not installing/validating dependencies, not debugging notebook execution), not an impassable environment."

The gpt-4.1 transcript shows consistent permission-denied failures for R library installation in both /usr/local and ~/R. Given the task depends on installing multiple R packages, and multiple independent agents ran into the same permissions barrier, the most plausible explanation is an impassable infrastructure restriction on write access to both the system R library and the effective home/user library location (or home is mounted non-writable). That would block any agent regardless of skill."
