Why I doubt an IFE: The failures are not shown to be unavoidable or caused by the harness rejecting valid solutions. Instead, the writeups repeatedly suggest agent-side causes (formatting/signature issues, extraneous preface text, or choosing the wrong interpretation of edge cases). Also, the three runs even report different user clarifications (error on key mismatch vs ignore missing keys vs sequences with zip), which points to agent/dialogue inconsistency rather than a provably broken benchmark.

Alternative explanations: A stronger agent could (a) output only the function with correct signature, (b) adhere strictly to one consistent interpretation demanded by the actual hidden tests, and (c) avoid extraneous text.

Why I doubt it qualifies as an IFE: Ambiguity alone is not an intrinsic formation error unless it is irreconcilable or the harness provably rejects reasonable solutions. Here, the other evaluations indicate the dialogue *did* clarify key points (whole-number percent, return the cut amount, and even whether to ignore year logic). That means a coherent interpretation exists and an agent can implement it. Even if some versions of the prompt are less explicit about `year_target`, a capable agent can still implement a defensible behavior (e.g., validate year_target >= 2023, or ignore it if instructed) and pass if tests match the clarified spec.

Alternative explanations: The failures described are consistent with agent-side issues: formatting/output problems (extra wrapper text), not following clarified requirements, or not handling expected validation (e.g., error when year_target < 2023). None of the evidence shows a contradiction or an evaluation harness bug that would reject all reasonable implementations.

A failure due to an extra period, different canonical name, or case-normalization is exactly the kind of agent-side strict-string-matching mistake that a careful implementation could avoid by adhering precisely to the prompt (or by clarifying in dialogue if allowed). The evaluations themselves are inconsistent about whether the default includes a period and whether matching is case-sensitive, which suggests evaluator confusion rather than a benchmark defect.

Alternative explanations: (1) The agent returned the wrong fallback string (punctuation/spacing/case). (2) The agent used different keys than the tests (e.g., missing plural/singular like Munchkin(s), or different phrasing for Glinda). (3) The agent mishandled case sensitivity/insensitivity.

Why I doubt it rises to an IFE: Underdefinition alone is not irrefutable evidence that the benchmark is unsolvable. Many coding benchmarks intentionally allow reasonable assumptions, and tests often check basic properties (e.g., uses provided parameters in a straightforward way) rather than a single secret constant. The evidence provided does not show a contradiction or an evaluation harness that rejects all reasonable solutions.

Alternative explanations: (1) Agent error is clearly present in at least one run: changing the required function signature by adding an extra parameter would predictably fail an autograder even if the internal logic were acceptable. (2) Another run ignored ad_duration, which could easily fail if tests expect it to be used; that’s an implementation choice, not proof the task is impossible. (3) A capable agent could keep the exact signature and implement a conventional model combining expected clicks (num_ads * clicks_per_ad * ad_display_probability * click_revenue) plus a duration-based term using an assumed rate (possibly derived from ad_type if it contains revenue_per_ad), without violating the interface.

Why I doubt this is an IFE: This is not irrefutably impossible or a harness defect. A capable solution can satisfy both by interpreting the requirements as: (a) normally enforce 1..10, but (b) explicitly allow 0 only for the before_grade edge case (and possibly after_grade==0 only in that same edge case), or by ordering logic so the before==0 case is handled prior to range validation. The evaluation notes the agent made the before==0 branch unreachable via its own validation, which is an agent implementation/spec-reconciliation failure.

Alternative explanations considered: The benchmark could have contradictory requirements if it demanded both strict 1..10 for all inputs and also special behavior for before==0. But the transcript explicitly says to “keep the logic for before_grade == 0 as originally stated,” implying an exception to the general range rule. That’s a reasonable, implementable interpretation; no evidence shows the grader rejects such an implementation.

In a benchmark with fixed hidden tests, that implies the reference solution must encode specific cutoffs/model labels that are not derivable from the prompt.

Why I accept it (skeptically): If the grader expects exact category names and exact numeric thresholds, then multiple plausible implementations (different year/trim/engine assumptions) will disagree while still satisfying the user’s request to “suggest defaults.” That is underdetermined: there is no single correct mapping implied by the text. This is not a case of the agent missing a clear requirement; the requirement itself delegates the key constants to the agent’s discretion.

Alternative explanations considered: (a) The benchmark might only test structural properties (e.g., function exists, handles inputs, returns one of the chosen labels) and not specific thresholds—then it wouldn’t be an IFE. But all three independent evaluations report failure with the same core reason (arbitrary hidden thresholds/categories), and the prompt excerpts show the user explicitly lacks the needed ground truth. (b) A better agent could “work around” by using a data source/API, but the task as described doesn’t provide such a source and typical offline unit tests wouldn’t allow network calls; moreover, even real data wouldn’t yield a single canonical mapping across Saab variants.

Why I doubt it: Contamination alone is not an IFE unless it makes the objective impossible to determine or causes the harness to reject correct solutions. Here, the core backend request is still clear (implement calculate_mineral_remaining with a given signature). Moreover, the dialogue evidence shows the user can and does provide a concrete assumption (linear yield factor and clamp at 0). That means a capable agent can converge on a testable spec and implement it.

Alternative explanations: The observed failures are plausibly agent-caused: (a) signature mismatch by adding an extra parameter (Evaluation 2), which would fail strict unit tests; (b) emitting invalid/non-clean Python (trailing junk / extra preface) (Evaluation 3). These are straightforward agent errors, not benchmark defects. Even if the frontend text is irrelevant noise, a better agent can ignore it and still produce the exact requested function.

Skeptical assessment: The frontend/HTML contamination is real but not an IFE that makes the task unsolvable—an agent can ignore irrelevant text and still implement the requested Python function. Two evaluations explicitly note this and attribute failure to agent-side mismatch (e.g., signature differences).

The stronger IFE claim is underdetermination. However, the evidence provided is not irrefutable that the benchmark lacks a determinate target: the dialogue (per other evals) appears to converge on concrete choices (1–10 scales, weights 0.5/0.25/0.25, interaction ideal range 3–10, 10% penalty per step outside). If those clarifications are indeed in the conversation, then the task is sufficiently specified and a capable agent could match tests. The conflicting evals suggest either (i) the underdetermination evaluator missed later clarifications, or (ii) different runs saw different dialogue; in either case, we do not have overwhelming proof that *no* agent could succeed.

Alternative explanation: hidden tests likely check a specific agreed-upon scheme and/or exact signature; the agent may have deviated (extra parameters, naming, clamping/rounding). That is agent failure, not a benchmark defect.

That is sufficient to implement a correct solution. The “uncertainty” mentioned concerns unspecified behavior (unsupported dough types, validation), which is not evidence of an intrinsic benchmark defect; tests can reasonably cover only specified behavior.

Alternative explanations: The failing runs are readily explained by agent-side choices—adding defaults for unsupported types, casting/validation, or raising exceptions—any of which could break hidden tests (e.g., boundary values like 0/2/425, or expecting no exceptions).

If those details are indeed in the transcript, then a deterministic, testable function is fully specifiable without inventing arbitrary constants. Under those conditions, failure is much more plausibly due to the agent choosing different weights/rounding/mapping than the benchmark expects, not because the benchmark is intrinsically impossible.

Alternative explanations considered: (1) The benchmark might still have a single “canonical” formula and reject other reasonable ones. But that would only be an IFE if the transcript *cannot* determine that formula. Given the reported user approvals (equal weights + maxima), a canonical linear normalization is inferable.
