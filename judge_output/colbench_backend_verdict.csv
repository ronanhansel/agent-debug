Why I doubt this is an IFE: The underlying task (expected maximum of k samples without replacement from {1..n}) is mathematically well-defined and solvable from the prompt alone; a capable agent can derive the closed form E[max] = k(n+1)/(k+1) or implement an equivalent computation. The evidence does not show the harness rejecting correct-but-different implementations; in fact, at least one run marked failed=false with a summation approach, suggesting the tests likely check numerical correctness, not exact source text.

Alternative explanations: The observed failures are clearly attributable to agent formatting/tool-use mistakes (not returning code in the required `final_answer`/code-block format), which is not a benchmark defect. The “user says I don’t know” about return type is not a contradiction and does not make the task impossible.

Final determination: No overwhelming, irrefutable evidence of an intrinsic benchmark/evaluation defect; failures can reasonably be explained by agent errors and the task is solvable."

A capable agent can implement exactly that without any clarifications. The fact that one run succeeded (“failed: false”) is strong evidence the benchmark is solvable as-is.

Alternative explanation: the failing agents introduced extra assumptions (case-insensitive matching, pre-initializing all keywords, deduplication, input validation) that diverge from the straightforward reference. That is agent error, not a harness/task impossibility. The simulator’s inability to answer edge-case questions does not constitute an intrinsic defect when a reasonable default (and the simplest reading) matches the reference and is implementable.

If the grader enforces this hidden condition, a correct, user-aligned implementation will be marked wrong unless it guesses an unrelated string-prefix constraint.

Alternative explanations considered: Could the task have mentioned SMTPS or a URL scheme requirement elsewhere?

A capable agent could still pass by inferring/replicating the reference behavior from tests (or by adhering to the provided hidden code if that is indeed the oracle). Also, the evidence is second-hand: we are not shown the full task prompt, full reference, or the actual failing test expectations—only an evaluator’s paraphrase.

Alternative explanations: (1) The task may define “percentage preserved” loosely (e.g., “number preserved” or “expected preserved count”), making the reference reasonable. (2) The evaluator may have misread the prompt or the hidden code context (e.g., other scaling/normalization elsewhere). (3) The observed failures in one run are plausibly agent-caused (following speculative user guidance rather than matching the reference), as even the evaluator notes.

It’s entirely plausible the prompt instructs to use “predefined data” (or otherwise implies a fixed table), in which case hard-coding is acceptable and not an intrinsic defect. The evaluations also explicitly note the runs did not fail (failed=false) and that an agent could proceed with a reasonable implementation and still pass—this strongly undermines any claim that the harness “definitively rejects valid solutions” or that requirements are impossible.

Alternative explanations: (1) The task may explicitly provide or imply the exact table in the visible prompt (not shown here). (2) The benchmark may grade behavior on a small fixed set of test cases consistent with the table; a capable agent can match it by following prompt details.

The simulated user saying “I don’t know” to extra questions is expected when the hidden spec doesn’t include those details, and does not create a contradiction or impossibility.

Why I doubt this is an IFE: Nothing shown indicates the benchmark is contradictory or impossible.

Alternative explanations: The failures in other runs can be fully explained by agent-side issues (e.g., returning ""unknown"" vs ""Unknown"" case-sensitivity, adding extra constraints like mutual exclusivity/type checks, or not eliciting/implementing the full mapping).

Two independent runs (Evals 1 and 4) reportedly passed with exactly that approach (numeric return + validation/docstring), demonstrating the task is solvable under the harness as-is. That directly undercuts the claim that no agent can satisfy both the prompt and the tests.

Alternative explanation: The failing run in Eval 3 is agent error—choosing to change the return type to a dict despite a standard expectation for a wavelength function to return a number.

Why I doubt it: This is not irrefutable evidence of a benchmark defect. The hidden logic’s speed>0 check is compatible with a “stationary” requirement if stationary implies speed==0; the absence of an explicit equipment_state=='stationary' check does not create a contradiction—it's simply a different (but still coherent) rule set.

A reference implementation regex like r'<([^>]*?)>(.*?)</\1>' strongly implies matching open/close tag names and extracting inner text; it is reasonable for a simulated user to infer constraints (e.g., simple tags, no attributes) from that. Even if some clarifications were inferred rather than explicitly stated, that does not make the task impossible or the evaluation harness rejecting valid solutions.

Alternative explanations: The observed failure is readily explained by agent error: using a regex that does not enforce matching tag names (""</[^>]+>"") can mis-extract or accept mismatched tags, diverging from the reference. Another run explicitly reports success (failed=false), demonstrating the task is solvable under the benchmark.

Why I doubt it’s an IFE: The later evaluations indicate the interactive prompt/user clarifies the intended approach (explicitly choosing the weighted-average option and related behaviors like adjusting totals and returning 0 when total_miles==0). Given that clarification, the task is implementable in a single intended way, and failures are explained by agent-side deviations (missing zero-total guard; adding an extra ValueError constraint not in spec/reference). That is not a benchmark defect.

Alternative explanations: Agents simply implemented a different formula (gallons-based) or added stricter validation than requested, or forgot an edge-case guard. A sufficiently careful agent could match the clarified weighted-average + total_miles==0 behavior and pass.

Why I doubt it rises to an IFE: the evidence shown is only a snippet of a purported hidden reference; we are not shown the actual test inputs. It is entirely plausible that the real test tuples are 4-element and the simulated user’s 3-element description is simply wrong (a normal agent-facing spec error), or that qb[3] refers to a different field in a 4-tuple while the user simplified the description. A capable agent could also defensively handle both schemas (e.g., accept either index 2 or 3 for games started) and thus pass regardless, which undermines the “no agent could overcome” requirement.

Alternative explanations: (1) agent failed formatting/protocol (explicitly noted in one eval), (2) agent followed the user spec but tests follow the hidden schema; that’s a mismatch but not proven intrinsic/impossible—robust code could accommodate, (3) the hidden snippet may be incomplete/out of context (e.g., tuples include an ID at index 2, games at 3).

The task prompt (as implied by the agents’ questions/assumptions) appears to ask for “CBA season/rates/brackets,” but the simulated user—restricted to hidden info—cannot/will not provide those constants because the hidden info is code and the user replies “I don’t know” to key specification questions.

Why this is likely a true IFE: If the public task description does not explicitly state the 0.15 base rate, the $5M step, and the 0.05 increment rule, then the expected output is determined by non-inferable hidden constants. That makes the task under-specified from the solver’s perspective, and the interactive channel is broken because the simulated user refuses/ fails to extract the needed details from the hidden code. In that situation, a correct solution cannot be reliably derived from the prompt+dialogue; success would depend on guessing the hidden implementation.

Alternative explanations considered: It could be that the original prompt actually did specify the simplified 15% rule and repeat-offender increment, and the agents simply ignored it and implemented real NBA brackets. However, the evaluations explicitly cite the agent asking for brackets and the user responding they don’t know, which strongly suggests the prompt did not provide the needed constants and the benchmark relied on hidden code.

That indicates the benchmark can be fully specified through interaction and is not inherently ambiguous. The fact that another agent returned different strings ('No wasabi applied', etc.) is consistent with agent failure to elicit/adhere to the required phrasing, not a benchmark defect.

Why I doubt it: the evidence is indirect and inconsistent across runs. Evaluation 1 explicitly notes the hidden reference returns longer strings but also states the run did not fail (failed=false) and that this “did not manifest as a benchmark defect here.” If the tests truly required the longer strings, a spec-following solution would systematically fail, not sometimes pass. That strongly suggests either (a) tests accept the short labels, (b) the evaluator is inferring hidden behavior without confirming test expectations, or (c) the longer strings are from a narrative/hidden description but not what the harness asserts.

Alternative explanations: the failing runs (Correct=0) could be due to agent implementation details (edge cases, precedence, invalid handling, formatting) rather than an unavoidable output-string mismatch. Also, the “hidden info” quoted may be from a simulated-user prompt, not the actual unit-test oracle.

Why this is not irrefutable IFE evidence: (1) A contradiction between a simulated user hint and the hidden reference is not automatically a benchmark defect; it can simply mean the user hint is wrong/misleading, and a capable agent should ignore/resolve it by inferring correct behavior from tests/spec.

One run even succeeded (failed=false) with the straightforward intended implementation. That directly contradicts the notion that the benchmark is inherently unable to communicate the schema or that “no agent could reliably recover” it.

Alternative explanations: The failing run(s) can be explained by agent-side choices: (a) assuming a different schema (game-level nested dicts) despite the reference being platform-level, and/or (b) output/protocol formatting issues (e.g., code fences / not adhering to required submission format), as noted in Eval 3.

(2) The evidence provided does not show the actual public prompt or the actual failing test cases; it’s speculative that tests include 'px' or require exactly 0.2646. (3) Even if 'px' exists in a hidden reference, that alone is not an IFE unless the evaluation harness definitively requires it contrary to the prompt.

Alternative explanations: the hidden 'px' factor may be unused, optional, or part of a broader internal solution not fully exercised by tests; the agent failure (in the run graded 1.0) could simply be due to missing a requirement that *was* in the visible prompt (not shown here) or other implementation mistakes.

But the full prompt is not shown here; it’s entirely plausible the intended contract is: tip_amounts is a dict of per-category tip amounts, and individuals_tipped is a list of individuals (or categories) to whom those tips apply, so multiplying by len(individuals_tipped) could be consistent with “number of individuals I need to tip” if that list encodes the individuals. Likewise, “per-category counts” may be the agent’s assumption, not the benchmark’s.

Alternative explanations: (1) The agent simply implemented the wrong function signature/types (list/tuple + zip) and wrong return type (formatted string) relative to tests expecting numeric return and dict input—classic agent failure. (2) The user saying “I don’t know” is not necessarily a defect; many coding tasks don’t require concrete values, only a function definition. A capable agent could still infer/adhere to the likely intended signature from the task statement (e.g., dict + list) and avoid formatting.

Why I doubt it rises to an IFE: This is not irrefutable evidence that the benchmark is impossible or that valid solutions are rejected. A capable agent could infer from the hidden/reference behavior (or from typical unit tests) that the expected output is the dollar gain, and could still satisfy the user by returning both values while ensuring the first element matches the expected scalar (e.g., return (gain, final_value) or adjust naming). Also, the evidence is second-hand: we are not shown the actual public prompt, the unit tests, or a failing trace demonstrating that any solution consistent with the prompt is necessarily rejected.

Alternative explanations: (1) The benchmark may define “ROI” colloquially as profit dollars, not the ratio; (2) the tests may only check the first element or accept multiple formats; (3) the agent failure (if any) could be due to choosing the ratio definition or tuple format without aligning to expected output.

Why I doubt it’s an IFE: (1) There is no irrefutable contradiction shown between the benchmark’s expected behavior and the task as actually evaluated; the benchmark may simply define “check_phyrgian_mode” as that last-interval predicate, however nonstandard.

(3) The other failures are plausibly agent/dialogue failures: the agent either pursued a musically conventional interpretation (descending semitone) or couldn’t extract the rule from the simulated user, but that does not prove the benchmark is defective—only that some agents didn’t converge on the hidden spec.

Alternative explanations: the simulated user behavior may vary across runs; some agents asked the right targeted question and got the actionable rule, others didn’t.

One run is marked failed=false and another explicitly attributes failure to the agent implementing the wrong scale and adding extra behaviors.

Why I doubt this is a true IFE: (1) The evidence is not irrefutable that the *tests* enforce ascending; it only shows a purported hidden reference snippet. (2) One run is explicitly reported as passing with a descending implementation (metadata `failed: false`), which directly undermines the claim that the harness rejects spec-compliant solutions. That suggests either the tests accept descending, the evaluation’s “hidden reference” excerpt is incomplete/misleading, or the pass/fail reporting is inconsistent.

Alternative explanations: the task could be intended to sort ascending (spec typo) or descending (reference snippet incomplete), or tests may not check order strictly. In any case, a capable agent can still succeed (and apparently did), so this is not an impossible/defective benchmark setup in the strong sense required for an IFE.

Why this is not irrefutable IFE evidence: None of these demonstrate that the benchmark/evaluator would reject a correct solution or that the task is impossible. An unused parameter is common and not contradictory; a capable agent can keep it and ignore it (as one run did successfully). The simulator occasionally adding extra details is a simulator-quality issue, but it does not prove the grading harness is broken; it may even make the task easier. The “arbitrary hidden logic” argument is essentially that the task is underspecified in natural language—this is not a proven formation error unless we can show the prompt and tests are inconsistent or that multiple interpretations are accepted/required. Here, the hidden reference implementation is internally consistent and implementable.

Alternative explanation: The failing run (Eval 4) is best explained by agent divergence from the expected reference behavior (e.g., compounding interest) rather than a benchmark defect. Other runs reportedly succeeded, which strongly suggests the task is solvable within the benchmark.

Tool-crash claim: Only one evaluation asserts an intermittent ask_user TypeError.

Why I doubt it / why it’s not irrefutable: We are not shown the actual task prompt, the unit tests, or the authoritative spec. The alleged “hidden reference code” could be misquoted, could be from a different run, or could represent internal generation logic rather than the scoring oracle. Also, the term concert_ticket_sales is semantically ambiguous (could mean number of tickets sold, could be redundant with attendance, could be a boolean/ratio), so multiplying by attendance might be wrong, but that alone doesn’t prove the benchmark is defective—only that one agent/evaluator believes there’s a mismatch.

Alternative explanations: (1) The correct spec is what the user says, and the evaluator’s supposed hidden formula is mistaken. (2) The correct spec includes concert_ticket_sales and the user instruction to ignore it is part of an interactive correction; a capable agent could reconcile by following the latest instruction. (3) Even if there is inconsistency, a robust solution could potentially satisfy tests by matching the tested formula.

Most importantly, the only concrete failure evidence provided (Evaluation 4) is about agent formatting/tooling (missing code-fence regex, wrong tool invocation), which is clearly agent-side and not a benchmark defect.

The “hidden info is code” complaint does not prove impossibility; a capable agent can simply implement the provided formula without needing extra units/array semantics, and at least one run reportedly succeeded. The tool-name mismatch/regex enforcement is a tooling/formatting pitfall, but it is clearly workaroundable by following the available tool spec (`final_answer`) and required code-fence format; evaluation 4 explicitly attributes the parsing error to agent formatting and notes recovery.

Nothing indicates rounding, validation, or special handling is required. A capable agent can simply implement the proportional formula with no extras and pass. The fact that some agents chose to add rounding/validation is an agent decision, not a benchmark defect.

Alternative explanations: (1) The benchmark likely tests for exact proportional outputs (floats) and agents failed by introducing rounding or extra branches. (2) Even if the user can’t clarify edge cases, the safest strategy is to mirror the minimal implied behavior; that is a workable path.

That strongly suggests the harness is not inherently incompatible with the task; rather, the agent/run configuration likely required code-fenced outputs per turn (a known agent-side formatting constraint) and the agent violated it. A requirement that the agent always respond with a code block can be a property of the benchmark interface for “programming” tasks, not necessarily a defect—especially if compliant agents can proceed.

Alternative explanations: (1) The “binary” variant run used a stricter wrapper that expects code-only messages; the agent should have complied by putting even questions inside a code fence (or using the provided ask_user tool correctly). (2) The failure is attributable to agent formatting/tool misuse, not an impossible/contradictory task or an evaluator that rejects valid solutions.

Alternative explanations: (1) The agent misinterpreted bycatch_reduction_plan type (boolean vs non-empty string) (Eval 3), a straightforward agent bug.

Alternative explanations: the failing run(s) can be explained by the agent choosing a narrower interpretation (parallel lists only) that doesn’t match the test inputs (dict), i.e., agent-side assumption mismatch rather than a harness that rejects valid solutions. Also, the “simulated user says parallel lists” is not proof the official tests require dict; it’s an inference from a purported hidden snippet, and even if true, it still doesn’t make the task impossible—just requires robust input handling.

Final determination: evidence does not meet the bar for an IFE (no proven impossibility or evaluator/harness contradiction)."

Benchmarks can legitimately encode non-intuitive rules; that alone is not an IFE unless it is contradictory/impossible or the harness rejects valid solutions. (2) Eval 1 reports a successful run (“failed”: false) and indicates the user did communicate key requirements; that directly undermines the claim that success is impossible. (3) We only have an asserted snippet of “hidden info code” from Eval 4, not the full task statement, full hidden implementation, or failing test evidence. It’s plausible the original prompt implied something like “concurrent serving considers the longest single charge regardless of outcome” (or similar), or that the evaluator misread the code/context.

Alternative explanations: The agent in the failing run could have implemented the more standard rule and thus failed tests, but a better agent could have probed further, inferred edge cases from examples, or matched the hidden behavior. Also, the discrepancy could be due to evaluator error or incomplete disclosure rather than an intrinsic benchmark formation problem.

A solution matching the hidden reference is straightforward to implement once inferred (and the hidden snippet is explicitly shown in the evaluations). The fact that the reference logic is arguably “wrong” scientifically is not, by itself, an intrinsic formation error—benchmarks can define arbitrary computations.

Alternative explanations: The failing agents likely implemented the natural interpretation (time = calories / burn_rate) rather than the benchmark’s intended computation. That is an agent-spec mismatch, not necessarily a benchmark defect.

Why I doubt it’s an IFE: This is not irrefutable evidence of a benchmark defect that no agent could overcome. The task’s intended behavior is fully well-defined by the hidden reference implementation; there is no contradiction in the benchmark itself. The failure mode described (agent adopting an incorrect mapping like negative=1) is plausibly an agent-specification/verification error: a careful agent could ask for (or propose) the exact formula and edge case (“Should it be (pos/total)*5 with total==0 -> 5?”) and wait for confirmation, or infer the simplest consistent interpretation (negatives contribute 0) given the 1–5 scaling request.

Alternative explanations: (1) The agent prematurely proposed an arbitrary mapping and got user approval, but that approval is not binding if it conflicts with the benchmark’s actual tests; the agent should reconcile requirements or request explicit formula. (2) The user’s “I don’t know” is not a harness-level impossibility; it’s a conversational obstacle that a stronger agent can route around by proposing the canonical formula and confirming.

Concretely, the function signature omits walks, yet the hidden solution reads walks from team_stats[player_name]['walks']; it also reads SLG from team_stats[player_name]['slg_pct'] rather than computing it from provided game inputs. Additionally, the simulated user explicitly instructs to assume walks=0 and approximate SLG as hits/at_bats, which conflicts with the hidden implementation.

Why this is an IFE (and not agent failure): A correct solution under the public spec/user instructions can reasonably (and in one run did) implement walks as 0 and compute SLG from hits/at_bats. If the evaluator instead expects the hidden behavior (use stored walks and stored slg_pct, plus the hidden OBP formula), then the task is intrinsically underdetermined/contradictory: the required behavior cannot be inferred reliably from the provided interface and dialogue. This is not merely a “hard” task; it’s a mismatch between what is asked/available and what is graded.

Alternative explanations considered: A stronger agent could try to ignore the user’s instruction and guess that team_stats contains walks and slg_pct and use them anyway. But that would be unjustified given the explicit instruction to assume walks=0 and approximate SLG, and the signature not including walks. Requiring such guessing indicates the benchmark is ill-formed.

Alternative explanations: The failing agents may have over-trusted optional/ambiguous user suggestions, while a better agent could adhere to the original function signature/spec or infer the intended formula from provided examples/tests. The parameter-name issue also looks like an agent mistake (changing a misspelled parameter that tests might require), not necessarily a benchmark defect.

Why I doubt this is an IFE: This is not a provably impossible or contradictory task; it is at most a misleading/underspecified description.

Why I doubt this is an IFE: (1) A weird or nonstandard spec is not automatically a benchmark defect; it can still be a well-defined requirement (even if unintuitive). The check is perfectly implementable once inferred: it simply raises when price*(1-margin) < 0. (2) There is no irrefutable evidence the harness requires this exact check in a way that makes the task impossible; Evaluation 1 explicitly notes a run passed (failed=false), which strongly suggests the benchmark is solvable and not rejecting valid solutions.

Alternative explanations: the failing runs likely stem from agent choices (e.g., ignoring the `margins` parameter) rather than an unsatisfiable or contradictory benchmark. The placeholder in the error string is cosmetic and unlikely to be a required exact message match.

Why this is not irrefutable IFE: The strongest concrete defect is the tool-name mismatch, but it is not shown to be unavoidable: at least one run passed despite other deviations, and even the failing run description admits the agent could recover by using `final_answer`.

Why this is not irrefutable IFE evidence: (1) At least one run explicitly reports success (failed=false) and provides a coherent, test-aligned spec (poll_type in {majority, percentage}, votes dict, tie handling, percentage denominator over eligible users, results ignorable). That strongly suggests the task is solvable and the harness can accept a correct solution. (2) The “under-specified” argument is not a proof of impossibility; many benchmarks rely on the interactive Q&A to disambiguate, and Evaluation 1 indicates the user did disambiguate sufficiently. (3) The “user refused to answer” claim is run-specific behavior, not a demonstrated intrinsic defect in the benchmark itself; different runs show different user helpfulness, so it’s not proven that *no* agent could obtain the needed details.

Alternative explanation: the failing agents implemented mismatching return schemas/denominators and mishandled `users`/`results` relative to the reference; those are ordinary agent-side interpretation errors, not a harness contradiction.

Why I doubt it: In Python, `x in some_list` is well-defined membership, and if tags are a list of strings, this is a coherent (if simplistic) interpretation: match if any tag exactly equals the query (case-insensitive). That is not an impossible or contradictory requirement; it’s just a different matching semantic. The evidence does not show that the public task statement *unambiguously* requires substring-within-each-tag rather than list membership. Also, two runs report success (failed=false), which strongly suggests the tests are satisfiable and that a capable agent can align with expected behavior.

Alternative explanations: (1) The agent in the failing run added extra behavior (word-splitting OR logic, joining tags into one string) that diverges from the likely intended/reference behavior; that’s agent error, not a benchmark defect. (2) The dialogue quoted in Evaluation 1 indicates the simulated user clarified substring matching in tags; if that were truly enforced by tests, the one-liner reference would be wrong—but we do not have irrefutable proof the tests actually enforce the dialogue over the reference, nor that the dialogue is the canonical spec for grading.

Alternative explanations: The observed failure mode described (agent adding extra validation/raising errors) is a classic agent-side overengineering that can break tests expecting simple multiplication.

Why this is not irrefutable: Nothing shown proves the public task statement (as given to agents) failed to specify the input types/structure. The evidence only shows (a) what the hidden solution does and (b) that the simulated user was unhelpful. That is insufficient to conclude a benchmark defect, because a capable agent could still implement a robust solution that accepts either scalars or iterables (e.g., sum if iterable, otherwise treat as scalar), which would satisfy both interpretations and avoid the alleged underdetermination.

Alternative explanations: The failing agents likely overfit to the user’s simplified formula and wrote a scalar-only implementation. That is an agent design/robustness failure, not necessarily a benchmark formation error. Also, Evaluation 1 indicates at least one run succeeded despite the same simulated-user behavior, undermining the claim that “no agent could overcome” the issue.

If the user can and did reveal the hidden logic, then there is no intrinsic benchmark defect—failures are attributable to the agent choosing/inferring a different model than what the user (or hidden code) specified.

Alternative explanations: (1) The failing runs reflect agent error: the agent followed an invented “option 2” or penalty scheme not actually mandated by the user/hidden code.

Alternative explanations: The observed failures are readily explained by agent over-assumptions (adding tie-breakers, input validation/coercion) that can diverge from the reference on ties or edge cases.

(b) Even if the user said to clamp, that is not irrefutable evidence the benchmark is defective; it could be that tests never cover over-extraction, or the user instruction is optional/negotiated behavior rather than a hard requirement.

Alternative explanations: A capable agent can simply implement the reference formula exactly (depth*1000 - extracted) and output clean Python without extra formatting; this would satisfy the likely tests.

One evaluation explicitly says the agent run did not fail and was accepted despite the alleged hidden behavior, which strongly suggests the tests are not strictly enforcing the exact hidden implementation (or the prompt allows multiple valid interpretations). (2) Having an unused parameter in a reference solution is sloppy, but not automatically an IFE unless it makes the task impossible to solve under the prompt.

Alternative explanations: the failing agent simply chose a different formula than the tests expect; the benchmark may be checking only sector-weighted GDP growth; or the prompt may have implied those weights/behavior.

Why this is not irrefutable: The core benchmark task, as evidenced by the hidden reference snippet, appears to be a generic function that counts unique hijacker identifiers across provided groups. That task is fully solvable without any external roster facts; the hidden solution itself contains no such facts and thus likely does not test for them. The “missing rosters” complaint therefore looks like a misunderstanding of what is actually being evaluated, not a benchmark impossibility.

On case-sensitivity: while a user instruction about case-insensitive matching could conflict with a case-sensitive hidden reference, we are not shown the actual public prompt or the test expectations—only an evaluator’s assertion plus a single line from the hidden code. It’s plausible the real prompt does not require case-insensitivity, or tests normalize input, or the evaluator over-interpreted a side comment. There is no demonstrated failing test or definitive proof that valid solutions are rejected.

(3) Alternative explanations: Failures can be fully explained by agent choices: adding extra behavior (e.g., capping/validation) not in the reference, or importing `typing` despite sandbox restrictions. The `typing` restriction is a known harness constraint and is easily worked around by omitting `typing` imports or using built-in annotations; the evaluator even notes the agent adapted.

Also, even if the simulator withholds weights in some conversations, a capable agent could still infer/replicate the expected formula by other means (e.g., reading task statement if it specifies, or implementing a reasonable function if tests are not strict on exact constants).

(2) Even the evaluator raising the issue states it did not cause the failure; the failure was an agent bug (incorrectly using age <= 5 instead of age < 5). (3) Unit ambiguity is not provably fatal here because the benchmark’s hidden logic is about numeric thresholds; a capable agent can still implement the exact thresholds and pass, and in at least one run it did.

Alternative explanations: the simulated user’s initial hesitation about units is just dialogue noise; the agent could ask again or proceed with the explicit thresholds. The only concrete mismatch cited is the agent’s boundary-condition mistake.

Why I doubt it: Under-specification in the initial prompt is not an intrinsic benchmark defect in this setting because the benchmark is explicitly interactive: the agent is expected to ask the simulated user for the missing rule. The hidden code contains a fully determinate spec, and a capable agent could elicit it by directly asking for the exact formula/thresholds. The failure described (agent inventing a different linear/MET model) is consistent with agent error, not an impossible or contradictory benchmark.

(2) Why I accept it: This is a direct, concrete output-type/structure mismatch (list vs tuple/dict; one group vs two groups). If the hidden tests are aligned to the hidden reference, then any implementation that follows the user-facing spec (two groups) will necessarily fail those tests, and any implementation that matches the tests (single list) will violate the user-facing requirements. That is an intrinsic task formation defect (spec-test contradiction).

(3) Alternative explanations considered: Could the evaluator be misreading the dialogue, or could the agent have been free to ignore the user’s requested interface?

Why this is not irrefutable IFE evidence: The truncation alone is not shown to make the task impossible—one run reportedly succeeded despite it, and truncation can often be worked around by inferring/asking for missing details. The stronger claim (contradiction) is based on an evaluator’s interpretation of “baseline guilt” and an assumed test expectation. It’s plausible the agent misinterpreted the user’s wording, or the user statement was paraphrased/ambiguous (e.g., “baseline” could mean the non-social value, which would indeed be doubled relative to the social case in the hidden code). Also, we do not see the actual tests or an authoritative statement that the simulated user message is guaranteed ground truth; we only see an evaluator’s narrative.

Alternative explanations: A capable agent could implement the hidden behavior directly (or clarify the meaning of social_setting) and pass. The failure described can be explained as agent-side choice to follow one interpretation rather than a provably impossible spec.

Why I doubt it qualifies as an IFE: the benchmark’s required output appears to be the formula itself, and the hidden snippet already contains an unambiguous, directly implementable specification. Lack of extra semantic/unit context is not a contradiction or impossibility; a competent agent can implement the function exactly as given without needing units. The evidence also shows at least one run where the user explicitly restated the needed formula, which further undermines any claim that the setup prevents success.

Alternative explanation: failures are attributable to agent mistakes (e.g., calling a forbidden tool `finish_answer`, adding unspecified behavior/validation), not to the benchmark/harness rejecting valid solutions. Nothing here is irrefutable evidence that correct solutions would be rejected or that requirements are impossible.

Why I doubt it: The evidence is not overwhelming or irrefutable. We do not see the actual benchmark prompt, the full trace, or the actual hidden tests. The claim hinges on (a) the simulated user truly introducing a cap requirement, (b) the hidden tests including cases with related_articles > 1000 where the cap changes the label, and (c) the agent being forced to follow the cap. None of these are proven here. It’s also plausible the agent unnecessarily proposed the cap and the user merely agreed, meaning a stronger agent could avoid introducing non-required behavior and stick to the core formula. Additionally, another evaluation reports the run succeeded (failed=false) with a clean spec matching the reference formula and no cap, which directly undermines the assertion that the task is intrinsically inconsistent.

Alternative explanations: (1) Agent error: adding extra constraints (capping/clamping) not required by the original task. (2) The tests may never exercise related_articles > 1000, making the cap irrelevant. (3) The “hidden reference provided in trace” could be misread or incomplete.

Alternative explanations: The agent likely failed due to implementation choices (skipping malformed rows, type coercion, input-type guards) rather than any impossible/contradictory requirement or harness bug.

We are not shown the full prompt, full hidden logic, or concrete failing test cases demonstrating that two identical semantic situations are scored differently. One evaluation even notes a run marked successful, which undermines the claim that the benchmark is inherently rejecting reasonable solutions.

Alternative explanations: The agent could have failed by assuming a single clean overlap rule when the intended behavior is a piecewise rule (even if quirky).

Alternative explanations: (1) The task is a standard 'implement a function per hidden reference' benchmark; the agent should have produced the exact specified outputs rather than advisory text. (2) The agent could have asked targeted questions to elicit/derive the needed categorical values (fresh/frozen/puree/extract; tart; sanitation concerns boolean) and then returned the exact expected strings.

Why I doubt it: This is not irrefutable evidence of a benchmark defect. Benchmarks often use arbitrary/renamed functions; “election year” could simply be a mislabeled leap-year task. That’s a spec-quality issue, but not necessarily an intrinsic formation error unless it makes correct completion impossible. A capable agent could still succeed by (a) extracting the exact rule from the user if the user has access to hidden code, or (b) inferring/guessing the full leap-year predicate as a robust 4-year-cycle rule with known exceptions (1900/2000), which is a common pattern.

Alternative explanations: The failure can be explained by agent behavior: it accepted a simplified divisible-by-4 rule after user agreement and didn’t implement the well-known century/400 exceptions. Also, one run is reported as not failed, suggesting the harness is not inherently rejecting solutions and that success is possible.

Why I doubt it: This is not irrefutable evidence of an intrinsic benchmark defect. It’s entirely plausible the intended task was simply “compute volume from length/width/height and convert units,” with “Easter egg” being flavor text. In that case, an ellipsoid interpretation is the agent’s choice, not a benchmark contradiction. Also, the unit constants are not clearly impossible: 16.387064 is a standard in^3→cm^3 factor, and 61023.7441 is approximately 16.387064*3723 (i.e., could reflect a specific liters scaling in the benchmark’s chosen convention). Even if the liters constant is unconventional, that’s not proof the benchmark is broken—just that the spec may be narrower than the agent assumed.

Alternative explanations: A sufficiently capable agent could match the expected behavior by inferring from examples/tests (or by interpreting the task as a box volume with given conversion factors).

Why I doubt it’s an IFE: the evidence is indirect and inconsistent across runs. At least two evaluations explicitly state the run metadata shows the agent did not fail (""failed"": false) despite using a general cubic-root approach that supposedly would be rejected by such a narrow hidden reference. That strongly suggests either (a) the hidden code snippet is not actually the scoring oracle, (b) the tests accept the standard mathematical solution, or (c) the evaluators are misinterpreting what the benchmark expects. Without concrete proof that valid, spec-following solutions are systematically rejected by the harness, the “magic range/discriminant” story is not irrefutable.

Alternative explanations: the benchmark may simply be asking for integer 2-torsion points in a bounded search (common in programming exercises), or the discriminant check may be a (clumsy) optimization/guard in the reference but not required by tests. The agent could also match such behavior if the prompt or examples implied integer search; we don’t see the full original prompt here.

Also, Evaluation 4 explicitly reports the simulated user *did* answer key behavioral questions (case/strip, index alignment), contradicting the claim that the setup prevents clarification.

Why I accept it: If the grader is keyed to the hidden code’s exact behavior (very likely in these benchmarks), then many reasonable implementations (different keywords, different phrasing, different return type like structured recommendations) will be marked wrong despite satisfying the natural-language request. The transcript evidence also indicates the simulated user cannot/will not provide the exact mapping/strings when asked, so an agent cannot reliably infer the required canned outputs from the prompt alone.

Alternative explanations considered: It could be an agent mistake if the prompt had clearly required those exact branches/strings or a single-string return; but the evaluation text explicitly says those details are not communicated and the user responses don’t supply them. A “better” agent could guess to implement exactly those three branches and strings, but that would be pure luck rather than derivable requirements—this is precisely an under-specified target relative to strict hidden tests.

Why I doubt it: This is not irrefutable evidence of a benchmark defect. The task’s natural-language intent (“return the first n items”) is commonly and reasonably implemented as slicing, and a capable agent can (and in other runs did) implement exactly input_list[:n] and pass. A single run where the agent added an n<=0 special-case is an agent choice/mistake, not proof the benchmark is impossible or contradictory. Also, the alleged problematic user message is not shown in full context here, and even if it occurred, agents are not forced to adopt that policy; they can adhere to standard slicing semantics.

Alternative explanations: (1) The agent overfit to a user clarification that was itself mistaken; (2) tests may not include negative n at all, making the discrepancy moot; (3) even if negative n is tested, the correct workaround is to follow slicing semantics, which multiple runs demonstrate is feasible.

Why I doubt it’s an IFE: This is not irrefutable evidence of a benchmark defect. A benchmark is allowed to choose an interpretation (even if arguably suboptimal) as long as it is consistent and solvable from the prompt. Here, a straightforward reading is: compute weighted average of the two averages as given; nothing in the prompt necessarily requires rescaling user scores to 0–100. The “mixed scale” concern is a modeling choice, not a contradiction. A capable agent could simply implement the simplest weighted-average behavior (matching the hidden snippet) and pass.

Why I doubt it: The evidence provided is second-hand and incomplete. We are not shown the actual natural-language task prompt, the full dialogue, nor the test harness.

Alternative explanations: (1) The prompt may already specify the 80% non-VIP rule and return strings, and the agent simply missed it. (2) The tests may be lenient (accepting any reasonable capacity check), explaining why a generic solution could pass.

Why I doubt it: This is not irrefutable evidence of an intrinsic benchmark defect. The presence of hidden ground-truth code and a weak/incorrect simulated-user response does not prove the task is impossible or that the evaluation harness rejects valid solutions. A capable agent could ignore the simulated user’s unhelpful replies and infer/replicate the intended behavior by other means if the task prompt (visible to the agent) contains enough specification, or by choosing a conservative implementation (e.g., only implement common fractures and return the exact fallback string) that might match tests. The evaluations do not show the actual public task statement, the unit tests, or a demonstrated contradiction (e.g., tests requiring both the hidden mapping and the user-provided mapping). They also conflict: one evaluation explicitly says the run “failed=false” (passed), which undermines the claim that “no agent could succeed.”

Alternative explanations: (1) The agent simply implemented the wrong logic (added complex-fracture multiplier, different brackets) despite the task being solvable; (2) the simulated user’s behavior is part of the challenge but not required to solve; (3) the hidden snippet may not be the sole source of truth for tests, or the tests may align with the agent’s implementation in some runs.

That can be an agent-dialogue failure (not asking in the right way, not persisting, not requesting the exact age brackets/return type, etc.) rather than a guaranteed, unavoidable extraction failure. Evaluation 1 explicitly notes the task is solvable via dialogue and that the hidden formula could have been obtained “if asked in a way that elicits the code structure,” and that run even shows failed=false, undermining the claim of an intrinsic impossibility.

Alternative explanations: A stronger agent could (a) ask more targeted questions (e.g., “Are there age bands like <6, <12, <18, else? What constants/divisors?”), (b) infer the likely intended simple piecewise structure from typical benchmark patterns, or (c) keep probing until the simulator provides the needed details. Also, the agent errors cited (invented formula, wrong return type/signature) are classic agent faults and do not prove the harness would reject all valid solutions.

Alternative explanations: (1) The task description/interactive clarifications may indeed specify the thresholds and normalization (or enough to infer them). (2) Even if the normalization is unusual, it’s still a coherent definition; agents could implement it once specified. (3) The discrepancy between Eval 1’s described reference (percent of individuals) and Eval 3’s described reference (divide by len*5) suggests evaluator inconsistency or misreading of the hidden reference, not a proven IFE.

Why I doubt it: (1) This is not a provable benchmark defect—hidden code being the source of truth is common in these tasks, and the agent is typically expected to implement the function/logic directly from the prompt/spec/tests, not to rely on the simulated user to restate it.

Alternative explanations: the failing agents may have overfit to conversational clarification and underfit to implementing the implied conditional logic; or they chose wrong input types/encodings. Nothing here shows the harness contradicts the task or that requirements are impossible.

If the agent instead invented a different spec (integers, printing), that is an agent failure, not a proven benchmark defect.

Why I doubt it: This is not irrefutable evidence of a benchmark defect—it's evidence of a mismatch between one agent’s interpretation and the hidden implementation. The task signature explicitly includes delta_t and names the point (t_n, x_i) in a way that can reasonably be interpreted as grid indices (common in PDE discretizations), where x_i is an index and delta_t is the grid spacing parameter (even if poorly named).

Alternative explanations: (1) The benchmark expects mirroring the provided signature/hidden code behavior; (2) The natural-language prompt may be underspecified, but underspecification alone is not an IFE unless it makes correct solutions impossible to accept.

Why I doubt it: this is not irrefutable evidence of an intrinsic benchmark defect. Many coding benchmarks intentionally have a specific intended algorithm; the fact that it’s “arbitrary” or not fully spelled out in the initial prompt does not prove impossibility. The evaluations themselves concede the user could reveal the exact logic “if asked precisely,” which means a sufficiently capable agent could elicit the needed details and implement the expected function. That makes this, at worst, a dialogue/elicitation failure by the agent, not a provable harness/spec contradiction.

Alternative explanations: (1) The task may be a typical ‘implement the described function’ where the full spec is obtainable via interaction; agents that didn’t ask for exact thresholds/outputs simply guessed a model and failed.

Why I doubt this is an IFE: This is not irrefutable evidence of an evaluation harness defect or an impossible/contradictory requirement.

The alleged inconsistency does not make the task unsolvable; it just makes it easier for an agent to go off-spec.

Alternative explanations: The failing agent likely added extra keys ('adjusted_value', top-level 'monitor_name') and mismatched the expected nesting, which is straightforward agent error under a strict unit test. A better agent could match the expected dict shape exactly.

The alleged divergence hinges on edge cases (years_grown==0, negative, non-int) that are not shown to be part of the benchmark’s required input domain or test suite.

Alternative explanations: (1) The benchmark likely assumes years_grown is a positive integer (common for “years grown”), making the agent’s extra validation/0-case irrelevant.

Why I doubt it: This is not irrefutable evidence of a benchmark defect. Many coding benchmarks present a natural-language story but actually test implementing a specific function signature and exact mapping; that’s a standard, solvable setup. A capable agent could (a) follow the provided function signature and docstring (if present in the task), (b) use the exact expected categories, and (c) implement the simple conditional mapping. The fact that one agent chose different enums and different RPG systems is an agent choice, not proof the benchmark rejects valid solutions.

Alternative explanations: The task likely included (or implied) the exact parameter names/allowed values; the agent deviated by inventing new categories and outputs. Even if the user dialogue mentions minutes/genre/cost, the correct move in these benchmarks is often to ignore irrelevant conversational details and implement the specified mapping. Nothing here proves the tests are contradictory, impossible, or that the harness would reject a correct implementation.

The user did confirm key parts: “Revenue should reduce the cost” and “Yes, multiply by years_in_operation.” Given typical programming-benchmark conventions, a capable agent could reasonably interpret the remaining ambiguity as: total expenses scale with staff_count and years, i.e., expenses is per-staff per-year (or per-staff per-period) and thus multiply by staff_count and years_in_operation, without inventing an unrelated salary constant. The agent’s introduction of ANNUAL_STAFF_COST is an avoidable modeling choice.

Alternative explanations: (1) The task statement (not shown here) may already define expenses as per-staff or per-year, making the correct formula derivable without further user clarification. (2) Even if the user was unhelpful, the agent could implement the simplest consistent interpretation (multiply expenses by staff_count and years, subtract revenue) rather than adding new parameters.

Why I doubt it: the evidence is second-hand and incomplete. We are not shown the actual task statement, the full hidden reference, or the full dialogue—only an evaluator’s paraphrase.

Alternative explanations: (1) The task statement may clearly define athlete_appearances/previous_test_results and the year-based logic; the agent implemented a different interpretation (date parsing) and failed. (2) The agent could have inferred likely structures from typical coding-benchmark conventions (dicts keyed by athlete) and written a robust solution handling both dict and list inputs, avoiding mismatch. (3) The evaluator’s claim that the user “cannot extract/communicate” structures from code is speculative; a simulated user could still be allowed to describe structures at a high level.

The provided evaluation itself states the failure was avoidable and attributes it to the agent’s assumption.

Alternative explanations: The task likely has a conventional interpretation (APR given as a percentage) consistent with many finance problems; the agent chose the other convention. Also, multiple runs simply show “incorrect” without evidence of harness rejecting valid solutions.

Why I accept it: If those quotes are accurate, the benchmark simultaneously (a) fixes the semantic meaning of `rest_time` and desired output direction, and (b) tests against the inverse mapping.

A capable agent can simply implement the straightforward, case-sensitive logic without needing extra clarification. The cited failure is that the agent chose to add case-insensitive normalization and extra matching logic, which plausibly diverged from the benchmark’s expected outputs—an agent error, not a harness/task impossibility.

Alternative explanations: the benchmark likely tests exact string membership; the agent’s normalization changes semantics and breaks tests. Nothing here shows the evaluator would reject a correct solution or that requirements are contradictory/impossible.

Why I doubt it: This is not irrefutable evidence of a benchmark defect. Many coding benchmarks intentionally provide only a brief spec and expect a conventional interpretation. A capable agent could choose a conservative implementation aligned with the function name/signature and typical unit tests: count occurrences of known border-style keywords in the provided CSS string and return a dict with all keys initialized to 0. The presence of an unused `html` parameter is not a contradiction; it can be ignored.

Alternative explanations: (1) The prompt likely implied counting border styles in CSS, not HTML parsing; (2) returning a complete dict with zeros is a common testing expectation; (3) fixed keyword list is a standard set of CSS border-style values.

Why I doubt it: This is not irrefutable evidence of a benchmark defect. Many coding benchmarks intentionally provide minimal/poor interactive feedback; agents are expected to infer requirements from the original prompt and/or implement a robust, conventional interpretation.

Alternative explanations: (1) The original task statement (not shown here) may have clearly implied an eviction-based reference table; the agent simply missed it. (2) Even if some details (units, return type) were unclear, a capable agent could implement the most standard behavior (integer division capacity, FIFO/oldest eviction, return the table) and likely pass.

Why I doubt it: A benchmark can legitimately define a simplified target behavior even if the story context mentions Spring/JPA. The hidden spec shown is fully implementable in pure Python without any external dependencies, and nothing in the provided evidence proves the public prompt *requires* real Spring integration rather than a lightweight representation. The agent in Eval 4 failed by returning the wrong structure (integer keys/custom class) and also had formatting issues; that is straightforward agent error, not a harness defect.

Alternative explanations: A sufficiently capable agent could ignore the Spring-import path uncertainty and implement exactly the required mapping structure (string keys 'transactionManager{i+1}' and values containing 'transactionManager' and 'entityManagerFactory'). The user’s “I don’t know” responses don’t block that solution; they only block a *different* approach (real Spring classes) that the hidden tests apparently do not require.

Benchmarks commonly have a single intended behavior (here, uniform scaling) and test against it; an agent is expected to infer/clarify requirements from the prompt, not from hidden code. The fact that a simulated user responded unhelpfully or ambiguously does not prove the task itself is contradictory or impossible—only that this particular agent run didn’t pin down the spec.

Alternative explanations: (1) The original task statement likely specified the decay behavior (e.g., “apply decay_rate to all previous scores”) and the agent ignored/misread it. (2) A better agent could ask targeted questions and refuse to assume geometric decay without confirmation, or implement the simplest interpretation (single-step scaling) which matches the reference.

Alternative explanations: the agent may have overcomplicated the scoring instead of implementing the simple rule set; the simulator’s “I don’t know” could be a response to an overly broad question rather than inability to provide specifics; the harness code-fence constraint is a known formatting requirement in some benchmarks and not necessarily a defect.

Skeptical assessment: (a) is not an IFE. The task (implement a function) is solvable without any user-specific facts; an agent can proceed with reasonable defaults and the given signature. A non-informative user is common in these setups and doesn’t make the task impossible.

For (b), the evidence is not irrefutable. “Total area” is ambiguous: it could mean total paper area (sum of areas of all sheets), which *does* scale with sheets_per_pad, not desk footprint. The reference implementation is internally consistent with that interpretation. The phrase “plan my desk space” suggests footprint, but it’s not a formal spec and doesn’t strictly contradict “total paper area.” A capable agent could also choose to follow the provided function signature/defaults and compute total paper area, matching likely tests.

Many coding benchmarks intentionally provide underspecified natural-language prompts and rely on the agent to implement the described behavior without interactive clarification.

Alternative explanations: A stronger agent could implement a robust interpretation consistent with common “vote outcome” tasks (e.g., treat votes as iterable of ints/bools, compute current total, and if below target, add votes until reaching target; return updated votes). Even if types are uncertain, one can write defensive code handling list/tuple/iterables and numeric targets. The evaluator’s assertion that “no agent could reliably infer” is speculative; the hidden code indicates a very straightforward function that could plausibly be derived from the original task statement.

Alternative explanations: The agent may have overcomplicated normalization (introducing maxima parameters) instead of following a simpler linear penalty for time; a stronger agent could infer 3600 as a reasonable default (1 hour) or ask and then choose a conventional assumption consistent with many benchmarks. Also, other runs are simply marked incorrect without any supporting explanation, which does not corroborate a benchmark defect.

The other runs provide no corroborating evidence—only binary incorrect flags without explanations.

(2) The agent could have failed due to other details (scaling rules, handling multiple gluten flours, merging quantities, preserving order/types, etc.).

Alternative explanations: The agent simply chose the wrong interpretation of “additional” and added extra behavior not in the reference. Nothing indicates missing dependencies, broken tests, or a harness that rejects valid outputs.

Why this is an IFE: The natural-language spec says to “calculate oxygen supply… taking into account depth/frequency and the rate the body consumes oxygen.” That does not uniquely (or even plausibly) imply multiplying an oxygen consumption rate into an oxygen supply calculation; a reasonable interpretation would involve ventilation-derived intake and then subtracting consumption (or otherwise combining them with clear units). The simulated user is constrained to only reveal hidden info, and per the evidence, cannot provide units or a model—so an agent cannot reliably infer the benchmark’s arbitrary multiplicative rule through clarification.

Alternative explanations considered: Could a strong agent guess the product formula anyway? Yes, but that would be pure guesswork among many equally plausible formulas; the task text provides no discriminating information to select that exact rule.

Why I doubt it: This is not irrefutable evidence of an intrinsic benchmark defect; it’s evidence of one particular interaction where the agent didn’t obtain/derive the spec. If the hidden info truly contains the exact rule, then a compliant simulated user could simply paste or paraphrase it verbatim when asked “what is the formula/threshold?” The evaluation provides no proof that the harness/user is incapable of doing so across runs, only that in this run the user responded vaguely.

Alternative explanations: (1) The agent could have asked more directly for the exact formula/threshold and insisted on any available details; (2) the agent could have inferred the intended simple linear rule from the function name/context if the prompt hinted at freezing point; (3) the simulated user’s vague replies may be an artifact of that run, not a structural impossibility.

Why I doubt it / alternative explanations: The evidence is inconsistent across runs. One evaluation asserts repeated `ask_user` runtime failures, but another run indicates the agent “successfully obtained all necessary details,” implying the interaction channel can work and the task is solvable. That strongly suggests the `TypeError` is run-specific (infrastructure hiccup, transient tool failure, or agent misuse) rather than an intrinsic benchmark defect that “NO agent could overcome.” Also, the supposed ambiguity about negatives/error handling is not a contradiction: the hidden reference code actually defines behavior (e.g., `bin(int(val))[2:]`, `str(int(val,2))`, else `'Invalid mode'`), so a capable agent could implement it without needing extra clarification. A simulated user giving a suboptimal answer is not, by itself, irrefutable proof of an IFE unless it makes correct completion impossible; here it does not.

Alternative explanations: (1) The user may have been asked in a way that didn’t elicit the thresholds; a better agent could ask more directly or proceed by implementing the simplest plausible rule and still pass if the user confirms. (2) Even if the user was unhelpful, a capable agent could still guess the exact thresholds (they are simple integers/round numbers) and pass—so it’s not “impossible.” (3) Most importantly, even perfect logic would fail if the submission format is rejected by the harness, which is what the evidence explicitly shows.

Alternative explanations: the failing agent chose a continuous numeric brightness model (0–100) and a formulaic drain-rate approach, which is an agent design choice; it could instead map brightness to categories (e.g., 'max' vs not) or accept string inputs, and could choose to ignore `hours_of_use` if the user indicates it’s not used.

Many coding benchmarks intentionally omit “domain semantics” and expect the agent to infer reasonable behavior from the prompt, or to implement a straightforward, consistent comparator.

Why I doubt it rises to an IFE: This is not irrefutable evidence of an impossible/contradictory benchmark. It’s entirely possible the original prompt (not shown here) or the interactive conversation was intended to elicit exactly that policy and exact strings, and the agent simply failed to extract/adhere to them. The evidence provided is second-hand (evaluators quoting “hidden info”) and we do not see the actual task statement, tests, or full dialogue. Without that, I cannot conclude the benchmark contradicts itself or rejects valid solutions.

Alternative explanations: (1) The task may have explicitly required reproducing the given reference function behavior (including 'Shared Jurisdiction'), making the agent’s “reasonable” interpretation irrelevant. (2) The agent could have asked for/confirmed return values and edge-case behavior; one evaluator even notes the user disclosed a different policy, suggesting the failure could be due to agent-user misalignment rather than a broken benchmark. (3) Even if the policy is non-intuitive, non-intuitive specs are common and still solvable.

Why I doubt it: The evidence provided is second-hand (an evaluator’s description of “hidden reference code”) without the actual prompt, dialogue transcript, tests, or reference implementation.

Alternative explanations: A capable agent could implement exactly the simple reference behavior and pass.

Why I doubt it: This is not irrefutable evidence of a benchmark/eval defect. The phrase “replaces the old tariff entirely” is plausibly consistent with the delta formula: replacing the old tariff with the WTO tariff means the cost should change by the difference between the two rates (i.e., remove old tariff effect and apply new), which is exactly what a delta-based adjustment encodes. The agent’s interpretation (ignore tariff_rate and apply only wto_tariff_rate on top of original_cost) is just one reading and is not forced by the wording.

Alternative explanations: The agent likely mis-modeled what original_cost represents (pre-tariff vs post-tariff) and/or misinterpreted the replacement instruction. A stronger agent could reconcile the statement with using both rates (compute adjustment by difference) and match the hidden implementation.

Even if the user was unhelpful, the task as described is still solvable by a capable agent without further clarification: implement a straightforward decision rule with reasonable defaults, or infer from typical patterns. More importantly, the evidence hinges on a particular dialogue failure mode (“user can’t extract from code”), but that is not proven to be intrinsic/impossible—many simulated-user setups can and do answer based on code-like hidden info. The evaluator’s conclusion that “no agent relying on dialogue could reliably infer the precise intended conditional” is speculative; an agent could ask differently, propose candidate rules, or implement the simplest conditional consistent with minimal assumptions.

Alternative explanations: The agent simply chose an incorrect heuristic (OR logic, list/averaging behavior) rather than the simplest threshold-based AND condition. That is an agent error, not necessarily a benchmark defect. Also, only one of four evaluations contains any substantive analysis; the others are blank, providing no corroboration.

Alternative explanations: The agent plausibly failed by (a) choosing a ratio instead of a difference and (b) effectively using a single value per group rather than averaging across all rows.

The error message explicitly indicates the regex wasn’t found because the agent responded with plain text (“I’m finished.”). That is an agent compliance failure, not a benchmark defect.

Alternative explanations considered: If the regex were overly strict or rejecting valid code, that could be an IFE—but the evidence shows the agent provided no code block at all, so we cannot attribute failure to the harness.

Given that, a competent agent could reasonably infer (or at least choose) a minimal output matching those labels, and many benchmarks do require exact output keys. The failure described is primarily that the agent returned a different schema (two booleans and extra fields) rather than the expected 'status'/'evidence' pair.

One run explicitly says `failed=false` (so the supposed mismatch did not prevent passing), while another asserts the agent failed because tests follow the hidden implementation—yet provides no concrete test failure output, no actual task prompt excerpt beyond a single sentence fragment, and no proof that the public task statement unambiguously requires per-hour bonus rather than allowing an interpretation where `bonus` is already the total bonus amount for that employee.

Alternative explanations: (1) The agent could have asked clarifying questions and aligned with the intended data semantics; (2) the benchmark may provide examples that disambiguate; (3) the evaluator may be misreading either the hidden code snippet or the natural-language statement; (4) the run marked `failed=false` suggests a capable solution can pass despite the alleged mismatch.

This conflicts with the natural-language/user-stated requirement to return strings like `""Amazing Spider-Man #129""` and (implicitly) to filter based on provided publisher/hero/series in a dataset-driven way.

Why I accept it as an IFE: The provided evidence includes the exact hidden solution code and a simulated user message explicitly stating they lack data-source/schema details and only specify output format and empty-list behavior.

Alternative explanations considered: (1) Perhaps the original prompt explicitly mentioned Metro Comix/Metro Man and range(1,200). But the evaluation text indicates the user could not provide such details and instead requested `Series #Issue` formatting, directly contradicting the hidden formatter. (2) Perhaps the task was intended to be a toy generator with those constants; however, then the user-facing requirements would need to state those constants and formatting.

That is enough to implement the reference behavior (linear scaling of the $1-change by gas_price_increase) without guessing.

Alternative explanation: The agent failed by changing the output schema (returning nested unit/percent changes and adding autodetection) and/or not matching the expected missing-key behavior.

Why I doubt it: This is not irrefutable evidence of a benchmark defect. Many coding benchmarks intentionally provide underspecified natural-language prompts; a capable agent can still implement a robust solution that matches the most likely/simple contract (e.g., treat attributes as iterable of strings; treat fact_checking_results as mapping; use .get defensively; accept multiple input shapes). The evaluator’s argument assumes the agent must rely on the user to reveal the exact contract, but nothing shown proves the prompt forbids making reasonable assumptions or writing compatibility code.

Alternative explanations: The agent could have (1) implemented the straightforward loop over attributes with mapping access, (2) supported both dict/list forms for fact_checking_results, (3) avoided overfitting to invented schemas. The failure described is plausibly just agent mis-specification/overengineering, not an evaluation harness that rejects valid solutions.

The simulated user reportedly provided the exact default weights and clarified that all required keys are always present and numeric, which removes ambiguity about missing-key behavior.

If the hidden info truly contains the full formula, a capable agent could implement that formula directly without asking for extra parameters. The fact that the agent asked for target glucose/carb ratio/weight factor and then invented defaults is an agent error (unnecessary clarification + hallucinated parameters), not a harness contradiction. The simulator saying “I don’t know” to irrelevant questions does not prevent solving the task if the task statement (or hidden spec) already determines the computation.

Alternative explanations: (1) The task prompt likely already specified the needed formula or enough to infer it; the agent deviated.

Why I accept it: If the benchmark truly grades against that trivial extension check, it directly contradicts the stated task goal (Illustrator-openable SVG). A filename extension is neither necessary nor sufficient for Illustrator compatibility, and it ignores the prompt’s emphasis on diagnosing why Illustrator can’t open a given SVG. That is a spec–oracle mismatch: a correct, prompt-faithful solution would be marked wrong, and the “correct” graded solution would not solve the described problem.

Alternative explanations considered: (a) Maybe the prompt actually only asked to verify the extension—rejected because the evaluation text explicitly frames the prompt as Illustrator compatibility/content-based diagnosis. (b) Maybe the extension check is a first-step heuristic but not the full expected solution—rejected because the evidence asserts it is the entire hidden intended solution. (c) Could a strong agent guess the oracle anyway? Possibly, but that would require ignoring the prompt and guessing an arbitrary grading rule; that’s exactly the kind of benchmark defect (misaligned hidden solution) that constitutes an IFE.

Also, even if some constants are not provided, many benchmarks expect reasonable defaults only if the prompt says so; otherwise the correct move is to implement exactly what the prompt states, not what the user “knows.”

Alternative explanations: (1) The prompt may have explicitly stated the thresholds and hobby triggers; the agent invented different ones. (2) The user simulation saying “I don’t know” could be irrelevant if the task never required eliciting them. (3) The evaluator may be misattributing a normal hidden-test strictness (exact string match) as an IFE; a capable agent could still pass by implementing the specified exact matches.

Why I doubt it: This is based on an unverified assertion about the hidden rule and about what the prompt/user actually said. We are not shown the original task statement, the actual hidden tests, or the full dialogue. The evaluator’s narrative could simply reflect one agent’s interaction or misunderstanding. Even if the hidden rule is as stated, it is not automatically an intrinsic benchmark defect: many benchmarks intentionally have a precise (even if simplistic) decision boundary, and the task could have explicitly required implementing that exact rule in the visible spec. Without the actual spec, we cannot conclude there is a contradiction.

Alternative explanations: (1) The visible instructions may have clearly specified the exact keyword logic; the agent implemented a broader heuristic and failed. (2) The examples quoted may be fabricated/partial or not part of the official prompt. (3) A stronger agent could have asked for clarification, inferred the intended rule from provided training examples (if any), or matched the spec exactly.

Why I doubt it: Eval 5 directly contradicts this by reporting a run where the simulated user *did* provide the critical details (allowed content_type values, room_light categories, and that user_preferences contains {'color_accuracy': bool}), and the run did not fail (failed=false). That strongly suggests the information is, in principle, obtainable and the task is solvable; the failure in Eval 4 can be explained by that particular agent/run not eliciting or using the needed details and producing an incompatible output schema.

Alternative explanations: (1) Agent error: returning a different schema (0–100 heuristics, color_temperature) instead of the expected discrete labels would fail even with adequate info. (2) Run-to-run variation in the simulated user’s disclosures or the agent’s questioning strategy, which is not an evaluation-harness defect.

Why this is not irrefutable IFE: The core task (implement `calculate_reserve_currency_loss`) is fully solvable from the hidden reference itself, and at least one run is reported as successful (failed=false) with an implementation consistent with `initial_value * exchange_rate_change`. That strongly suggests the benchmark is not inherently impossible or self-contradictory. The “simulated user answered with details not in hidden info” is a simulator-quality issue, but it does not prove the benchmark’s tests are invalid; it more plausibly explains why one agent was misled into adding abs()/clamping and then failed—an agent-side failure given the actual expected behavior is simple.

Tooling mismatch is also not decisive: many benchmarks include minor instruction/tool-name drift; agents can still complete via the available `final_answer` tool (as shown). The stray `python_interpreter` mention could be logging/adapter noise rather than a harness defect that rejects correct solutions.

Alternative explanation: The failing run(s) likely failed because the agent implemented different semantics (absolute loss / clamp at 0) than the reference expects, not because the benchmark cannot accept a correct solution.

About the tool error: The evidence is indirect (an evaluator summary) and not corroborated by multiple runs here (other evaluations are blank). Even if ask_user was broken, that still wouldn’t prevent producing the correct minimal function.

Why I doubt it: The hidden reference implementation shown is a straightforward normalized weighted average: (hp*w1 + tq*w2 + weight*w3 + speed*w4) / sum(weights). That is a common, reasonable default for “weighted average,” and a capable agent could implement it without needing extra clarification. The fact that one agent chose to invert weight and omit normalization is an agent design choice, not proof the benchmark is impossible or contradictory.

Alternative explanations: (1) The agent simply misinterpreted “weight” as something to penalize and changed the formula. (2) The simulator’s “I don’t know” responses may reflect a limitation in that particular run’s dialogue, but another run reportedly passed (“failed: false”), indicating the task is solvable within the benchmark. (3) Even if the simulator sometimes fails to translate code into a direct “raw vs normalize” answer, the agent can still infer the intended behavior from typical conventions or by asking for the formula directly.

Why I doubt it: This is not evidence of a benchmark/evaluator defect. The benchmark appears to have a clear intended implementation (the provided hidden snippet).

It’s common in these benchmarks that the *tests* define the required behavior, and any extra “user preference” text can be non-binding or misleading.

(3) The prompt may have been clear about returning a list, and the agent followed an optional preference incorrectly.

The agent’s failure is explained by adding extra policies (raising ValueError for out-of-range passengers, inventing a default seat price when None) that conflict with the reference.

It’s plausible the agent could have inferred or reverse-engineered the required behavior from tests, examples, or by implementing the hidden-code logic directly if it was accessible in the repository/context. Also, “user refuses to answer” is not automatically an intrinsic benchmark defect; many ColBench tasks intentionally require the agent to proceed with incomplete requirements and still satisfy tests via other signals.

Alternative explanations: (1) The agent may have failed to locate the ground-truth logic in the provided files (common agent error). (2) The task may include unit tests that fully specify expected outputs, making dialogue unnecessary. (3) The simulated user’s responses might still have been sufficient if the agent asked differently or proposed candidate schemes and validated them.

Why I doubt it: This is a single evaluator’s narrative with no primary evidence from the actual task prompt, the agent’s full conversation, the unit tests, or the benchmark spec. The “hidden info code” is asserted but not verifiable here. It’s also plausible the agent misinterpreted the intended meaning of “service stops at last re-election year” (which could mean service through that year, not +4), or that the evaluator is mischaracterizing either the prompt or the reference.

That directly undermines the assertion that the benchmark/user-simulator systematically withholds the needed information or that “no agent could infer it.” With conflicting evidence, there is no irrefutable proof of a benchmark defect.

Alternative explanations: The failing runs can be explained by agent-side choices (e.g., committing to a logistic model and continuous insecticide index) and/or by run-to-run differences in dialogue strategy (not asking the right targeted questions early, or not extracting the rule when it was available). Also possible: evaluator misread the trace or different simulator behavior across runs—neither is proven to be an intrinsic, unavoidable benchmark defect.

Why I doubt it: this is based on an evaluator’s asserted “hidden reference implementation” details, but no primary evidence is provided (no prompt text, no actual failing test cases, no harness output, no reference code excerpt from the benchmark).

Why I doubt it: This is not irrefutable evidence of a benchmark defect. A benchmark can legitimately define behavior purely by a mathematical relationship without specifying real-world units; the function signature and tests can treat inputs as abstract scalars. The agent’s choice to introduce unit conversions and propagation delay is an agent-side modeling decision that deviates from the (apparently) intended simple formula. The user saying “I don’t know” to unit questions does not prevent an agent from implementing the simplest consistent interpretation (direct proportionality/inverse proportionality) or from defaulting to a unitless model.

Alternative explanations: A sufficiently capable agent could (a) infer the likely intended simple computation from typical coding-benchmark patterns, (b) avoid overengineering and implement a straightforward formula, or (c) provide a minimal implementation with clear docstring assumptions.

Why I doubt it: The evidence does not show an unavoidable contradiction in the benchmark itself—only that some agents followed a user-driven redesign that likely diverges from the (hidden) tests. In these coding benchmarks, the safe/standard strategy is to keep the original function signature and implement the most plausible behavior from the prompt; a capable agent can also resist or roll back “preference” changes that would break compatibility. Evaluation 4 explicitly shows a pure agent-side failure (missing required code block), demonstrating the harness can accept solutions when formatted correctly.

Alternative explanations: (1) The prompt likely already specifies the signature/return format; the agent’s deviation is its fault. (2) Even if the simulated user suggested changes, an agent could ignore them to satisfy the original spec and pass. (3) The hidden decision tree/labels may be inferable from the prompt (common classification labels) or at least the prompt may explicitly require them; we are not shown the original task text to prove otherwise.

The same evaluator explicitly states a better agent adhering to the tool protocol would succeed, which directly contradicts the definition of an intrinsic formation error (must be unavoidable).

Why I accept it: The evidence includes the exact hidden reference code. That code’s output is not a volume under any consistent unit system; it is explicitly normalized by the bed volume. The prompt provides no indication that a normalized fraction/ratio is desired. This is a direct spec–oracle mismatch: the evaluation target contradicts the plain-language requirement.

Alternative explanations considered: One could argue the task intended “fraction of bed filled,” but that would need to be stated; nothing in the prompt suggests normalization.

Why I accept it: The evaluation explicitly quotes the hidden reference implementation: it checks membership in fixed lists like ['shaving','haircuts','music'] vs ['parties','weddings','concerts'] and otherwise returns 'N/A'. The natural-language task description (as summarized) asks to “categorize different activities into two time periods during the Omer” but does not specify any canonical activity-to-period rule nor these exact activity names, nor that the output must be the corresponding list of days rather than a period label. That is underdetermined: multiple reasonable solutions exist, and a correct-by-prompt solution can still fail if it doesn’t guess the exact hidden lists and output format.

Alternative explanations considered: It could be agent failure if the prompt actually contained the exact activity lists, the 1–24/25–49 split, and the required output structure. But the provided evidence asserts the prompt lacks these specifics and contrasts it with the hidden code’s “magic lists.” Given the direct citation of the reference behavior and the described mismatch, the most plausible conclusion is an intrinsic spec/test misalignment.

Many benchmarks include implicit/typical conventions (e.g., “remove_www_if_exists” sounds like an override) and a capable agent could choose a deterministic policy matching the likely intent (e.g., treat `remove_www_if_exists` as higher priority, or document and implement that). The fact that one agent chose to raise an error is an agent design choice, not proof the task is impossible or the harness rejects valid solutions.

Alternative explanations: The agent also appears to have added extra URL normalization behaviors (urlparse-based parsing, default-port stripping, returning unchanged for schemeless URLs) that diverge from the simple hidden reference.

(2) Why I doubt it’s an IFE: This is not a provable benchmark defect that makes the task unsolvable.

The agent can (and should) infer required behavior from the prompt/tests context; lack of additional clarification from the simulated user does not inherently prevent a correct solution.

Also, Evaluation 3 explicitly notes the run did not fail (""failed"": false), undermining the claim of intrinsic impossibility.

Another run (Evaluation 1) reports no failure and indicates the simulated user provided clarifications consistent with the hidden reference (storage decreases by sum of required quantities; createability requires presence of materials; process in list order).

Alternative explanations: The failing agent likely implemented a different (but plausible) interpretation—consuming material quantities and/or building repeatedly—despite (or without successfully eliciting) the benchmark’s intended rules.

A stronger agent could (a) implement linear wind reduction with a documented scaling, (b) use half-life in a decay factor, or (c) inspect/align with typical unit conventions if the prompt suggests them. Nothing here proves the harness rejects valid solutions or that requirements are contradictory/impossible.

Final determination: Evidence is insufficient to conclude an intrinsic formation error; the observed failure can reasonably be attributed to agent implementation choices rather than a provable benchmark defect."

Why I doubt it: None of this is irrefutable evidence that the benchmark is impossible or that the harness rejects valid solutions. A capable agent could ignore the misleading real-world framing and implement the minimal behavior implied by the prompt inputs (tank size, fixture, plant type, growth rate) in a deterministic way; if the evaluation expects the hidden reference, an agent could still match it by producing a simple branching function over those inputs without needing extra clarifications (the agent already controls the code it writes). The “user can’t answer” argument is weak because the agent doesn’t need the user to reveal the hidden code; it needs to infer what the grader expects, and in these benchmarks that often means implementing a straightforward mapping from the stated parameters.

Alternative explanations: The failures can be fully explained by agent choices—returning a dict/heuristic PAR calculator instead of a simple string-returning rule-based function, or not matching exact expected strings/branches.

Alternative explanations: The benchmark may intentionally test following a provided comparator rule rather than real-world CVE reasoning.

Why I accept it: If the unit tests are keyed to that exact formula and boolean cutoff, then the task is underdetermined from the visible spec: the constants 100 and 0.5 are arbitrary and not inferable. Multiple evaluations cite the simulated user responding “I don’t know the threshold/unit” despite the hidden code containing it, and/or approving incompatible requirements (categorical output, extra parameter).

Alternative explanations considered: An agent could guess the exact formula/threshold by luck, or ignore the user’s stated preferences and implement a simple boolean rule.

Why I accept it: The evidence quoted is concrete and directly contradictory: hidden info encodes an exact formula, while the user says they “don’t know” any conventions and approves a constant (20,20) or other heuristics.

Not realistically—there’s no principled way to derive `title_bar_height + 2*border_thickness` and `max(10, window_height//4)` from the underspecified prompt plus user statements that deny having a formula.

Alternative explanations: The agent could have asked explicitly about any additional taxes beyond state tax; if the simulated user had that info, it could be elicited. Or the hidden ‘federal tax’ may be from a different variant, dead code, or not used in scoring. Also, defaulting unknown states to 0 is a reasonable, non-contradictory choice and not an impossibility.

Final determination: There is not overwhelming, definitive proof that the benchmark necessarily rejects all valid solutions due to a malformed spec. Given the reported successful runs and the possibility of agent-side elicitation/interpretation, this does not meet the bar for an intrinsic formation error."

If at least one run succeeded with the same task, that is strong evidence the benchmark is solvable and not intrinsically broken.

Alternative explanations: The failing run in Eval 4 is plausibly due to agent-side issues (not asking the right questions, not persisting, or mis-implementing despite partial info), or due to run-to-run variation in the simulated user behavior rather than a provable, unavoidable benchmark defect. Variation/one bad simulated-user response is not irrefutable evidence that “no agent could succeed,” especially given a successful run.

Why I doubt it: there is no concrete evidence that the evaluation harness actually checks for in-place mutation or for preserving original order in the num_spots>len branch. Many unit tests would only check returned values, in which case a spec-compliant implementation that returns the top-N (and returns all contestants when N exceeds length) would pass regardless of mutation. Also, returning all contestants when N exceeds length is a very standard interpretation; whether they are sorted or not is ambiguous, but ambiguity alone is not an irrefutable IFE without proof that the tests enforce the “unsorted” behavior.

Alternative explanations: the agent could simply implement exactly the reference behavior (including in-place sort and the early return) and pass; Evaluation 1 even reports a successful run consistent with the hidden code. The “simulated user added details not in code” is not a demonstrated evaluation defect—extra narrative about dictionaries/numeric fields doesn’t prove the benchmark rejects valid solutions.

Why I doubt it: The evidence is second-hand and incomplete. We are not shown the full task prompt, the exact evaluation harness expectations, or the actual failing trace/output. One run is explicitly marked as not failed, which strongly suggests the task is solvable as posed and that the “code-as-hidden-info” did not make the task impossible. The “unknown” mismatch is also not proven to be an evaluation contradiction: many benchmarks allow extra labels internally but only test on inputs that never trigger them, or accept mapping 'unknown' to one of the two classes.

Alternative explanations: The failing agent may have over-relied on dialogue instead of implementing a reasonable heuristic; or it may have mishandled edge cases/formatting.

The hidden reference implementation is fully well-defined and implementable; nothing indicates the harness would reject a correct solution. The fact that the simulated user didn’t volunteer details is not a contradiction or impossibility in the task—agents are expected to implement the function from the prompt/spec, not to rely on an oracle user to reveal the reference code.

Why I doubt it: The evidence is inconsistent across runs. Evaluation 1 explicitly reports no failure (failed=false) and states the agent obtained requirements and produced a reasonable function, which strongly suggests the benchmark is solvable as presented and not inherently broken.

Alternative explanations: (1) The failing agents may have deviated from what the tests actually check (e.g., wrong keys, normalization, edge cases) rather than being trapped by missing constants.

Why I doubt this is an IFE: underspecification alone is not irrefutable evidence of a benchmark defect. Many coding benchmarks intentionally have a single expected implementation; a capable agent can often infer likely expectations from the prompt (e.g., simple flat-earth approximation, basic Python, returning coordinate arrays) or avoid asking questions and implement the simplest interpretation.

Also, at least one run is reported as succeeding, which strongly suggests the task is solvable within the benchmark setup.

Alternative explanations: the failing runs likely stem from agent choices (different earth model, different output structure, different polygon definition) rather than an evaluation bug. The “user can’t reveal hidden code details” complaint is speculative unless we see that the prompt explicitly requires those details to be discoverable via dialogue; the agent could simply implement the most straightforward version aligned with typical beginner GIS approximations.

Alternative explanations: The failing run (Eval 5) appears to be agent error: it invented unsupported pointer types/architectures instead of implementing a minimal rule-based function with a safe fallback.

The fact the user says “I don’t know” to type/structure questions does not prove the task is impossible; it just means the agent shouldn’t rely on those clarifications. (2) The supposed contradiction (“without losing any error messages” vs mutating model_state[field_name]) is interpretive. It’s plausible that model_state stores posted values per field (not errors), or that errors are stored elsewhere; overwriting a field entry does not necessarily “lose error messages.” Without the actual prompt text and harness expectations, this is not provably inconsistent.

Alternative explanation: the failing agent simply implemented different semantics (updating viewModel and preserving model_state) than the tests expect (mutating model_state as in the reference).

Why this is likely a true IFE: If the public prompt only says the index should be “based on” several factors and “take into account” violence, then many implementations are equally valid. A test harness that requires one particular set of weights and a particular violence transformation is effectively testing hidden, non-derivable details. Evaluation 4 reports a failure attributable to using a different (still reasonable) violence scaling and a different rebel-support direction, which would be unavoidable without access to the hidden reference. The evidence includes the hidden reference implementation itself, showing the exact expected formula.

Alternative explanations considered: It’s possible the prompt (not shown here) actually specified the weights and exact violence term, in which case this would be agent error. However, multiple evaluations explicitly state the prompt did not include these details, and the hidden code is presented as the only source of the constants. Also, some runs succeeded only after the simulated user “provided” the exact weights—suggesting success depends on leaking benchmark-internal specifics rather than solving a well-posed spec.

Why I doubt it: We are not shown the actual benchmark prompt/spec, the real hidden tests, or the real hidden reference beyond a quoted snippet. The snippet itself is not necessarily the full reference implementation; `desired_ranking` could be an int (0/1) in the true spec, making the code coherent.

Likewise, the “user simulator answered callable” inconsistency could be an artifact of that particular run’s dialogue, not an intrinsic benchmark defect.

Alternative explanations: (1) The intended API is simply `desired_ranking` as an index (0 or 1), and agents that assumed otherwise failed. (2) The hidden tests may not exercise the problematic path (e.g., always pass 1), so no impossibility exists.

Why this is not irrefutable: We are not shown the actual task prompt, the full hidden reference code, the full simulated-user transcript, or the scoring harness behavior—only an evaluator’s summary. That is insufficient to prove a benchmark defect. Even if the simulated user gave misleading guidance, a capable agent could (a) request the exact code snippet / constants verbatim, (b) ask for clarification on types (categorical vs numeric), (c) cross-check by asking for example input-output pairs, or (d) infer inconsistencies and resolve them. The evaluator’s statement that “a better agent could not reliably recover” is speculative without seeing whether the interaction allowed such verification.

Alternative explanations: The agent may have mis-elicited requirements, misinterpreted the user’s answers, or overfit to partial guidance (e.g., implementing a linear -0.10*burning_frequency despite discrete cases). Also, the binary runs show incorrect=0 but provide no evidence of an evaluation-harness contradiction.

Why I doubt it / alternative explanations: This is not irrefutable evidence of a benchmark defect. The prompt (as summarized) can reasonably be interpreted as computing an overall USA–China trade balance and reporting it per listed country (a broadcast), even if it’s a bit odd. That behavior is internally consistent and implementable by a capable agent. The agent in the cited run appears to have steered the spec toward a different API/return shape (nested dict with overall_total) and per-country dict inputs—choices that would obviously fail if the benchmark expects the simpler broadcast dict. That is an agent-specification mismatch, not necessarily an intrinsic formation error.

Additionally, one evaluation notes run metadata “failed=false,” which directly undermines the claim that the benchmark necessarily causes failure. The evidence provided does not show that the task statement *cannot* support the hidden behavior, nor that the harness rejects valid solutions, nor that requirements are contradictory/impossible.

Alternative explanations: The failing agents likely made incorrect assumptions (e.g., paying when growth is below target, omitting multiplication by total_retirees) despite the expected logic being straightforward once inferred/derived.

The provided evidence does not show the actual task prompt, so we cannot conclude the prompt was too vague/contradictory to solve. The agent’s need to ask about “sacrifice_factor” could simply reflect an underspecified prompt that still has a reasonable canonical interpretation (common in benchmarks), or an agent failure to infer/choose the intended behavior.

Alternative explanations: (1) The prompt may have clearly specified the piecewise behavior or sign convention, and the agent ignored/misread it. (2) Even if somewhat underspecified, a capable agent could implement a straightforward interpretation consistent with typical specs (e.g., linear tradeoff) and pass tests if the prompt implied it.

A capable agent could simply implement this straightforwardly without needing any additional user-provided examples, scales, rounding rules, or case-insensitivity. The agent’s divergence (returning None, adding rounding and case-insensitive matching) is an agent choice, not proof the benchmark is defective.

Alternative explanations: (1) The benchmark is a standard “implement this function” task where the correct behavior is exactly the reference; the agent overgeneralized. (2) The dialogue requirement to “gather information” may be stylistic, but not necessary to pass; the agent could ask briefly and then proceed with reasonable defaults aligned to typical reference behavior (or infer from the function name/pattern).

The hidden reference confirms that the benchmark’s intended behavior is exactly that simple sort; nothing is contradictory or impossible.

Alternative explanation (more likely): the failing run deviated from the reference by adding a secondary alphabetical tie-break and extra type-checking/raising, which can change outputs and thus fail strict tests.

Even if the agent attempted to import urllib.parse and was blocked, that does not prove the benchmark is impossible or defective—only that this particular agent approach used a disallowed module. Many URL-joining/encoding tasks can be implemented without urllib.parse (e.g., manual string handling/percent-encoding) within the allowed modules, so the restriction is not inherently contradictory unless the task explicitly requires urllib.parse or requires behavior that cannot be reproduced without it.

Alternative explanations: (1) The agent chose a standard-library import that is disallowed in this sandbox; a better agent could implement equivalent functionality without forbidden imports. (2) The evaluator may have incorrectly inferred the hidden solution or conflated the agent’s code with the reference.

A capable agent can still succeed by prioritizing the actual benchmark spec/tests (typically: implement the described function) and avoiding speculative behaviors that change outputs/exceptions.

Alternative explanations: The observed failures are clearly agent-caused in at least one run (disallowed import from `typing`, and not returning a fenced code block matching the harness regex).

Also, the task says to use “provided text” as the sole source, but the simulated user cannot provide that text, while the hidden info contains the needed dataset only as code.

Why I accept it: The overlap-vs-containment mismatch is a direct, concrete contradiction between the explicit natural-language requirement (“any part overlaps”) and the hidden ground-truth logic shown in the evidence. If the evaluator is built from that hidden code, then an agent that correctly follows the user’s stated overlap rule will systematically disagree with the benchmark on boundary/partial-overlap cases.

Alternative explanations considered: (1) The evaluator might not use the shown hidden code—however the evaluation text explicitly treats it as the reference implementation/ground truth.

The noted failures are clearly attributable to agent behavior: not following the required output protocol (returning code blocks instead of a raw function string; malformed tool invocation with an extra 'python' token and wrong tool name). That is not an evaluation harness defect.

Alternative explanations: A competent agent could comply with the tool/format constraints and implement the straightforward classification logic exactly as specified. Any remaining mismatch (e.g., edge-case handling) is speculative and not shown to be impossible or contradictory.

Why I doubt it: This is not irrefutable evidence of a benchmark defect; it is consistent with ordinary agent failure to infer a simple, common schema from the task context and/or to implement defensively.

Nothing presented proves the harness rejects such robust solutions.

Alternative explanations: (1) The task prompt likely already implied the intended structure (toolbar categories/items) and the agent overfit to an incorrect assumption (mutating availability, using 'plugins'/'available'). (2) The hidden reference is a straightforward boolean presence check; an agent could implement that behavior while supporting multiple input shapes. (3) The “user can’t translate code-encoded facts” argument is speculative; we are not shown the full task statement or that the benchmark explicitly forbids reasonable inference.

Skeptical assessment: This is not irrefutable evidence of an intrinsic benchmark defect. Even if the public prompt omitted the third status, a capable agent could still pass by implementing robust parsing that handles bytes/str, checks for the explicitly provided markers exactly, and (optionally) includes an extra state for “new version available” without harming other cases. The bytes-vs-str issue is also not inherently impossible: a correct solution can accept both types (common in Python) and decode conditionally. Exact-string dependence likewise is a normal, solvable requirement; the simulated user actually provided the exact phrases for success/failure, and the agent deviated by using generic substrings.

Alternative explanation: The failures are attributable to agent implementation choices (generic matching, missing the extra state, assuming `output` is str only), not to a harness that rejects valid solutions.

Why I doubt it: the evidence provided is second-hand and incomplete. We are not shown the full task prompt, the full dialogue, or the actual simulator policy. It’s entirely plausible the agent simply failed to ask the right question (e.g., “What is the exact pass/fail rule?”) or failed to interpret an answer that did contain the rule. Also, the hidden info being code does not inherently prevent the user from stating the rule in natural language; many such benchmarks expect the agent to elicit exactly that. The evaluations’ conclusion (“no agent could infer 24”) is not irrefutably established without seeing that the user was asked directly for the pass criterion and still refused despite it being in hidden info.

Alternative explanations: (1) agent error in requirements elicitation; (2) agent over-designed a rubric instead of implementing the simplest plausible rule; (3) the simulator may have provided enough hints (e.g., typical component max scores) that a better agent could deduce the threshold; (4) the tests may accept any reasonable policy rather than the exact 24 rule (we have no test evidence).

Why this is an IFE: This is a direct spec–reference mismatch. A correct solution under the written spec (boolean improvement with 1–10 validation) will fail if the harness expects the hidden implementation’s numeric percentage output and its 0-grade edge cases.

The presence of a hidden reference implementation with fixed thresholds is standard; lack of explicit constants in a conversational setting is not, by itself, a harness defect.

Alternative explanations: The failing runs likely stem from the agent overcomplicating the interface (dict-of-dicts / per-restaurant structures) and inventing different cutoffs (e.g., B>=75) rather than adhering to the simplest plausible contract.

Why I accept it: If the hidden solution truly is exactly as shown, this is a direct, objective contradiction between the natural-language requirement (range partitions defined by boundary dates, yielding N+1 partitions) and the implementation the tests are likely keyed to (hash/group-by exact value, yielding as many partitions as distinct values). These behaviors are not equivalent and cannot be reconciled by minor interpretation differences (inclusive/exclusive endpoints, parsing, etc.). A correct-by-prompt range partitioner will necessarily fail tests expecting equality-grouping, and vice versa.

Alternative explanations considered: (1) The evaluator could be mistaken about the prompt’s intent; however, “range-partitioning requirement” plus a `dates` parameter strongly implies boundaries, and a solution that never uses `dates` is implausible as a faithful implementation. (2) The hidden snippet could be incomplete or not the actual tested reference; but the evaluation explicitly cites it as “Hidden information provided,” and the mismatch is stark.

Alternative explanations: any failure would be due to agent overengineering (adding validation, type coercion, exceptions, etc.) that diverges from strict tests expecting plain multiplication. The unhelpful simulated-user responses do not make the task impossible; a competent agent can ignore them and implement the minimal formula.

Final determination: no overwhelming, irrefutable evidence of a benchmark/evaluation defect. At most, there is minor conversational awkwardness, not an intrinsic formation error."

The existence of at least one run marked as not failed further weakens any claim of an intrinsic benchmark problem.

Why I doubt it: This is not irrefutable evidence of a benchmark defect. If the hidden info truly contains explicit code `height * 25`, then a sufficiently capable agent could infer the intended rule directly from the provided spec/tests (or from the same hidden info if it is actually exposed via the task materials) without needing the user to restate it. The failure described is consistent with agent behavior: it asked an unnecessary question, then overrode the most plausible interpretation and implemented a BMI formula. That’s an agent mistake, not a proven harness contradiction.

Alternative explanations: (1) The prompt or unit conventions likely made direct multiplication the intended mapping; the agent could have implemented it without confirmation. (2) The “simulated user must only answer from hidden info” constraint doesn’t imply they must answer every question; they may respond “I don’t know” if the question is about interpretation rather than literal text. (3) Even if the user response is unhelpful, the benchmark can still be solvable via reading the original task statement and/or tests.

Alternative explanations: (1) Agent error: ignoring a parameter named `rating` is a suspicious choice absent strong justification; a better agent might implement `clip * rating` averaging and pass. (2) The evaluator may have misattributed the hidden code as the sole ground truth; the benchmark might accept multiple behaviors or have different tests.

The test suite then appears to grade against the hidden code’s exact formula.

Why this is an IFE: If the benchmark’s ground truth is the hidden code, but the dialogue channel cannot reliably convey that exact formula/constraints (and instead elicits contradictory or invented requirements), then an agent that correctly follows the user conversation can be led away from the true expected implementation and will fail tests. That is a formation mismatch between (a) what the agent is supposed to optimize (user-stated requirements) and (b) what the evaluator checks (hidden implementation).

Alternative explanations considered: It could be “agent fault” if the user had clearly specified the exact formula and the agent deviated. But the provided evidence indicates the opposite: the user’s stated requirements diverge from the hidden code and even approves a different formula.

The natural-language task (as implied by the dialogue) does not provide this rule, and the simulated user—restricted to answering only from hidden info—still refuses/claims ignorance, so the agent cannot obtain the required blacklist tuples.

Why this is an IFE (and not agent failure): If the evaluation harness expects the exact hidden behavior (tuple-not-in-two-specific-tuples), then any solution derived from reasonable domain assumptions (regex checks, resolution thresholds, allowed colors, etc.) will fail on cases crafted around those two tuples. Since the decisive information is (a) arbitrary, (b) non-inferable from the task text, and (c) not obtainable via the user interaction due to the user’s non-disclosure/ignorance, a capable agent cannot reliably reconstruct the expected function from the provided interface.

Alternative explanations considered: It could be agent error if the task statement explicitly specified the two forbidden tuples or an equivalent rule, or if the user could reveal them when asked.

Why I doubt it: The only concrete “evidence” is a quoted snippet purported to be the hidden reference. We are not shown the actual prompt, the official tests, or any authoritative artifact proving the benchmark expects the non-summing behavior.

Also, the prompt wording could plausibly mean “return the totals per category” (already pre-summed), not “compute sums from lists.”

Alternative explanations: Agents may have failed due to formatting/edge cases (e.g., required default categories, required return type, handling missing war names) that are consistent with a valid spec.

The prompt, per the evaluation, only says to consider factors like number of releases and stability, but does not define the structure/type of `language_stats` nor specify any 90% proportion rule.

Why this is an IFE: If the benchmark truly enforces a specific container/record shape (len(), stat[1]) and a specific 0.9 proportion constraint that are not stated or inferable from the prompt, then multiple reasonable implementations (e.g., dict-based stats, aggregate stability, different aggregation rules) will be rejected despite being consistent with the visible spec.

Final determination: No overwhelming, irrefutable evidence of an intrinsic benchmark/evaluation defect. The observed failure is attributable to agent formatting/protocol noncompliance, and the alleged `>=` mismatch is not proven to be unavoidable or to break evaluation."

Why I doubt it: This is not irrefutable evidence of an intrinsic benchmark defect. Many coding benchmarks intentionally define behavior solely by a reference implementation; agents are expected to match that behavior (including its quirks) rather than elicit extra requirements. The fact that an agent asked about whitespace, malformed inputs, deduplication, or repeated authors and the user said “I don’t know” does not prove the task is impossible or contradictory—only that the agent’s strategy (adding extra robustness) can diverge from the reference.

Alternative explanations: A sufficiently careful agent could implement exactly what the reference code does (split on ':' then split concepts on ','; no stripping; no dedup; later duplicates overwrite earlier due to dict comprehension) and pass. Also, one evaluation explicitly reports the run did not fail (“failed: false”), which strongly undermines the claim that no agent can succeed.

Final determination: Evidence is mixed and does not meet the ‘overwhelming, irrefutable’ bar for an IFE.

Why this is not an IFE: (1) A minimal reference solution is not, by itself, a benchmark defect; many benchmarks intentionally specify only core behavior. Lack of extra edge-case policy does not make the task impossible or contradictory—an agent can implement the straightforward split-and-drop-first behavior.

That is not irrefutable proof of a benchmark defect.

Alternative explanations: (1) The prompt may have clearly specified the exact ground_type strings and constants; the agent ignored/misread them. (2) The agent could have asked clarifying questions or adhered to a minimal spec rather than introducing new output scales.

A capable agent can simply implement the minimal, conventional interpretation of “calculate time = distance/speed” without adding extra validation, units, or rounding. The inability to get unit/rounding details does not make the task impossible; it just means the safest solution is the simplest one.

Alternative explanations: The observed failure is fully explained by agent choice—adding ValueError/type checks that diverge from a likely reference. Many benchmarks expect exactly the straightforward computation and do not require (or want) extra input validation.

Here, the evidence provided indicates a concrete hidden reference behavior (return a dict name->rank; rank = i+1 after sorting by total weight) and the agent deviated by (a) returning a different type (list of dicts) and (b) implementing a different tie policy (competition ranking with skipped ranks). Those are agent choices, not proof that the benchmark would reject all reasonable solutions.

Alternative explanations: A stronger agent could have matched typical expectations: return a dict of ranks, use deterministic ordering, and choose a simple sequential ranking even if ties exist (or break ties deterministically). The user’s “I don’t know” on ties does not make the task impossible; it just means the agent must pick a reasonable default.

Why I accept it: If the prompt truly does not specify the keyword set or scoring mechanism, then the target function is underdetermined: many implementations satisfy the stated requirement, but the harness will only accept the single hidden heuristic. That is a benchmark formation defect (specification mismatch), not an agent capability issue.

Alternative explanations considered: (1) The agent could have asked clarifying questions and been given the exact list—however the evaluation notes the simulated user is constrained and only provided the vague statement, so the needed details are not obtainable. (2) The prompt might have contained the keyword list elsewhere—no evidence of that is shown, and the evaluator cites the hidden snippet as the only place with the exact list.

Why I doubt it: The other evaluation explicitly states the simulated user provided clear, extractable formulas matching the hidden reference (including the pigs_weaned-based survival denominator and the *100 scaling). That directly undercuts the “not inferable via dialogue” claim. Even if formulas are nonstandard, that is not an intrinsic defect if the interactive/user channel can specify them; a capable agent could ask targeted questions (e.g., “Is survival rate a fraction or percent?” “Is farrowing_rate_percentage meant to be a percent or a count derived from pigs_born_alive?”) and then implement exactly.

Alternative explanations: The failure is plausibly agent-side: (1) implemented different formulas (didn’t multiply survival by 100; treated farrowing_rate as pass-through), (2) added rounding/validation that may diverge from expected raw outputs, and (3) output formatting included an extra leading 'python' token that can break strict harnesses.

Why I accept it (despite skepticism): This is concrete, specific evidence of a spec–tests contradiction. If the required function signature truly has only the four listed parameters, there is no principled way to compute a per-game average from those inputs alone unless the benchmark silently assumes a fixed number of games (not stated). Any implementation that actually computes an average per game must introduce an additional assumption/parameter or divide by something not provided, which would necessarily diverge from the hidden reference formula that does not average at all.

Alternative explanations considered: (1) The phrase “per game” could be sloppy wording and they really meant “adjusted total yards” for the season. But then the task description is materially misleading, and the function name “calculate_average_yards_per_game” reinforces the average interpretation. (2) The benchmark could assume a constant games-per-season; however, that would still be an intrinsic under-specification because the constant is not given and can vary (16/17/18, college, etc.).

Final determination: Overwhelming evidence of an intrinsic formation error: the natural-language requirement and function naming demand an average, while the hidden expected behavior (and signature) cannot support or does not perform averaging. A capable agent cannot satisfy both simultaneously."

The agent repeatedly failed to include the required ```python ...``` block, which directly explains the “regex pattern ... was not found” errors. Additionally, the agent’s returned strings/behavior diverged from the expected messages shown (e.g., “Resizing not available” vs “Resize operation not available”), which would fail strict tests but is again an agent compliance issue, not an impossible/contradictory spec.

Alternative explanations considered: A competent agent could (1) always respond with the required fenced code block, and (2) match the exact return tuple structure and error strings. Nothing indicates missing dependencies, contradictory requirements, or an evaluator that rejects valid solutions.

Why I doubt it qualifies as an IFE: Underdefinition/hidden-reference arbitrariness can be an IFE only if it makes correct completion impossible or the evaluation rejects a broad class of clearly valid solutions. Here, the evidence provided does not show that: (a) the simulated user interaction apparently specified key constraints (string toy names, internal dict mapping, any-overlap rule, return list, empty list if none), and (b) the agent’s failure is plausibly due to deviating from the reference (inventing a different mapping, skipping unknown toys rather than matching reference behavior). That is consistent with an agent mismatch, not a provable benchmark defect.

Alternative explanations: A stronger agent could have aligned more closely with the implied/expected toy set (e.g., only implement the toys mentioned/used in tests, or ask clarifying questions and then implement exactly those). Also, even if multiple mappings are “reasonable,” the benchmark may still be testing a specific mapping as part of the task (common in coding benchmarks), which is not inherently a formation error.

We are not shown the actual task prompt, the full hidden tests, or any concrete failing cases demonstrating an unavoidable contradiction.

Alternative explanations: (1) Agent bug: mishandling of unicode fractions, whitespace, or unexpected tokens; (2) Spec actually expects invalids to count as 0 (not ignored); (3) ""4.5"" may not be required/valid input; (4) The evaluator’s quoted “simulated user” lines may be incomplete/out of context.

Why I doubt it: The evidence for the supposed contradictory user confirmation is not actually shown in the provided excerpts—only the evaluator’s assertion. By contrast, there is concrete evidence that failures were due to agent mistakes: (a) tool/formatting errors (wrong tool name, missing required code-block wrapper / malformed final_answer call) and (b) implementing behavior that diverges from the hidden reference (returning 0 instead of ""Invalid input"" for empty/non-list; skipping non-ACGT bases).

Alternative explanations: Even if the dialogue contained some ambiguity about ambiguous bases, a capable agent could still match the benchmark by following the more central, repeatedly stated rules (reference = first filtered sequence; zip-to-reference-length mismatch counting; input validation). Also, the primary recorded failures are execution/formatting issues unrelated to benchmark formation.

Why I doubt it: This is not irrefutable evidence of a benchmark defect. (1) The alleged spec/reference contradiction is not proven from the actual task text—only paraphrases are provided. It’s plausible the real prompt actually matches the hidden logic (e.g., “serve cache when backend down or error” without an age constraint, or defines “error” as 4xx–5xx). (2) Even if the prompt mentions “not too old,” that could be interpreted as a general guideline rather than a strict requirement, or could be overridden by other wording (e.g., “always serve cache on backend failure”). Without the exact prompt, we cannot conclude impossibility/contradiction.

Alternative explanations: The agent may simply have implemented the wrong policy (common off-by-spec: treating only 5xx as error, requiring freshness during backend-down, restricting cache codes to 2xx/304). A stronger agent could infer from typical caching semantics or from unit-test-driven iteration and converge to the hidden behavior. The “simulated user said I don’t know” is not an evaluation-harness defect; benchmarks often include unhelpful users, and agents are expected to proceed.

Why I doubt an IFE: There is no demonstrated contradiction in the benchmark spec, no proof the harness rejects valid solutions, and no missing dependency/environment problem. The described mismatch is a classic agent-overfitting/overengineering failure: if the tests expect the minimal behavior, adding stricter exceptions/messages can fail.

Alternative explanations considered: (1) The prompt might have explicitly required ValueError on empty or iterable acceptance—if so, the hidden reference would be wrong. But we are not shown the original prompt, and there is no evidence the tests contradict the prompt; Eval 3’s narrative suggests the agent elicited extra requirements beyond what the benchmark expects.

Why I doubt it rises to an IFE: Underspecification alone is not irrefutable evidence of an intrinsic benchmark defect unless it makes correct completion impossible for any agent. Here, a capable agent could still plausibly match the hidden behavior by choosing common benchmark conventions: (a) preserve input structure by returning items/tuples rather than just titles, (b) use Python’s default case-sensitive membership, and (c) implement a stable sort key that prioritizes matches and can incorporate index() as a tie-breaker. Nothing shown proves the harness would reject all reasonable interpretations; it only shows the agent chose different defaults.

Alternative explanations: The failure can be fully explained by agent-side choices (case-insensitive matching, returning titles only, different ordering criterion) and, per one evaluation, even output-format/parsing noncompliance. The “simulated user can’t answer clarifications” is a common constraint in these benchmarks and does not itself prove impossibility; it just means the agent must pick sensible defaults.

Alternative explanations: (1) The agent simply didn’t elicit the exact required strings; a better agent could ask for example outputs or exact wording if the task is an exact-match generation benchmark. (2) The evaluation may allow any five quotes meeting constraints (not exact match), and the failing agent violated some hidden but elicitable constraints (length, punctuation, exact formatting, etc.).

Why I doubt it: The evidence is not irrefutable. It relies on a single evaluator’s assertion of the hidden reference code, but we are not shown the actual prompt text, the official unit tests, or the full reference behavior. Many benchmarks phrase tasks loosely (e.g., “calculate revenue and profit margins”) while tests may only check revenue and profit, or may accept additional outputs, or may define “profit margin” differently (numeric vs formatted string). Also, an agent could plausibly satisfy both by returning exactly what tests expect (two values) while still “calculating” margin internally, or by matching a documented signature if provided.

Alternative explanations: (1) The agent returned an extra value or formatted margin as a percentage string, causing failure even if margin was expected numerically. (2) The prompt may have actually asked for revenue and profit (not margin), and the evaluator paraphrased incorrectly. (3) Tests may validate only two outputs; a capable agent would infer required signature from function stub/docstring and comply.

Why I doubt it: The evidence provided is indirect and rests on an assumption that the benchmark requires the agent to exactly match those internal key names/structures. Many programming benchmarks allow any reasonable schema as long as the implemented function behavior matches tests; the agent could also choose to implement a robust solution that accepts multiple plausible schemas (e.g., support both 'conditions' and 'required_fields', both 'matching_conditions' and 'criteria'), or infer from the prompt itself (not shown here) what the expected I/O is. The evaluations do not show the actual task prompt, the unit tests, or a definitive contradiction (e.g., tests requiring exact key names while the user is prohibited from revealing them). They also don’t prove that “no agent could succeed”: a stronger agent might read the hidden-code hints from the user’s allowed disclosures, implement flexible parsing, or ask different questions.

Alternative explanations: (1) Agent failure: it committed to an invented schema and return type (dict vs boolean) that likely mismatched the prompt/tests. (2) The prompt may have specified return type/structures clearly, and the agent ignored it. (3) Even if the user was unhelpful, the task may still be solvable by implementing the most standard interpretation (e.g., boolean completeness check) or by making the function tolerant to schema variations.

Final determination: The record does not provide irrefutable proof of a benchmark defect (contradictory requirements or a harness that rejects valid solutions).

Alternative explanations: Agent protocol/formatting noncompliance (not wrapping code in the required string/code block) fully explains the failure. A more careful agent could satisfy both the functional behavior and the output contract.

Why this is not irrefutable: we are not shown the actual benchmark tests, only a purported snippet/description. Even if the reference uses naive splitting, a capable agent could still match it (by intentionally mimicking the split behavior) once the behavior is inferred from examples or by asking targeted questions. The supposed contradiction with the user statement (“NETID is always a query parameter”) is not logically incompatible with naive splitting; it can still be a query parameter while being extracted incorrectly by the reference. That would be a benchmark-quality issue only if tests include URLs where correct query parsing and naive splitting diverge—and that is speculative here.

Alternative explanations: the agent may simply have implemented behavior that doesn’t match the benchmark’s expected (possibly intentionally simplistic) behavior; or the tests may never include additional parameters after NETID, in which case `parse_qs` would pass. Also, the other evaluation explicitly argues the failure is attributable to agent choice and that requirements were sufficiently inferable.

Why I doubt it: This is not irrefutable evidence of a benchmark defect. Many coding benchmarks intentionally require implementing behavior from the prompt alone without interactive clarification; a simulated user refusing to elaborate is not inherently a formation error. The key question is whether the natural-language task statement (not shown here) is genuinely contradictory/impossible or whether it reasonably specifies the required behavior. The evidence provided does not demonstrate a contradiction or an evaluation harness that rejects valid solutions—only that some agents asked for extra specs and then implemented different logic/signatures.

Alternative explanations: (1) The prompt likely already specifies the thresholds/distribution in text, and the agent/user dialogue is irrelevant to passing tests. (2) Even if under-specified, a capable agent could choose the simplest interpretation consistent with the signature (e.g., compute per-type totals and a radius multiplier) without needing “distances” or bins; the agent’s decision to invent a different distribution model or change the signature is an agent failure, not a benchmark defect. (3) The presence of a hidden reference implementation with particular constants does not prove the prompt lacks them; it only shows what the tests expect.

Also, even if the user in the dialogue said they “don’t have desired weightings,” that does not prove the benchmark spec lacked them—benchmarks often define requirements independent of a simulated user’s uncertainty.

Alternative explanations: (1) The task likely asked for a specific deterministic formula; the agent deviated. (2) The agent could have asked for or derived the intended formula from provided examples/constraints (not shown here). (3) The evaluator may be misattributing a mismatch between agent output and tests to an IFE without proving the tests contradict the written requirements.

Final determination: Evidence is not irrefutable that the benchmark is defective or impossible; there is reasonable doubt and plausible agent-failure explanations. Therefore, grade 0."

Then: if speaker and listener are co-located, “here” is correct; otherwise “there” (listener’s location) is correct. Nothing in the evidence shows that `location` is *not* the speaker’s location. The evaluator’s “inverted rule” characterization is unsupported.

Alternative explanation: The agent simply deviated from the reference by adding `.lower()` normalization. If the tests expect strict equality, that’s a normal, solvable requirement; the spec’s lack of explicit case-sensitivity guidance is common and does not make the task impossible or contradictory.

Why I doubt it: This is a single evaluator’s narrative with no primary evidence from the benchmark itself (no actual prompt text, no actual hidden tests, no harness behavior, no full hidden reference, no failing trace). The claim hinges on what the evaluator says the hidden reference contains and how the tests are written. It is entirely plausible the hidden tests do NOT rely solely on that snippet (e.g., kid-friendly logic could be elsewhere, or tests could be prompt-based/behavioral rather than strict reference matching). Also, “no return-format requirement” is not necessarily a defect; many tasks accept any reasonable format or specify it elsewhere.

Alternative explanations: (1) The agent could have failed to infer/implement kid-friendly criteria from the prompt or common-sense heuristics; (2) the benchmark may provide kid-friendly criteria in parts not shown here; (3) the hidden reference snippet could be incomplete/partial, with additional functions for kid-friendly and list handling; (4) tests might only check gay-friendly despite prompt wording (prompt overreach is possible, but not proven).

Many benchmarks intentionally have a hidden reference implementation; the fact that the user didn’t disclose it doesn’t prove the task prompt was impossible or contradictory. A capable agent could still implement a conservative, literal interpretation (e.g., match principle names directly in the action text and normalize by total weight) without needing the hidden code.

Alternative explanations: The agent simply over-engineered (keywords, proportional relevance) and diverged from what tests expect; that’s an agent failure. Also, we don’t see the actual user-facing task statement here—only an evaluator’s reconstruction—so we cannot confirm genuine ambiguity/contradiction in the prompt.

The observed failure in that run is clearly attributable to the agent deviating from the reference (clamping the output to [0,1] and reframing as a probability), plus earlier protocol/formatting issues. That is not an intrinsic benchmark defect.

Alternative explanations: The “user withheld weights” behavior could be run-specific simulation variance, not a benchmark impossibility.

Many tasks intentionally leave some details implicit and expect a “minimal” or “reference-matching” behavior; a capable agent could implement a conservative rule that would still satisfy such tests (e.g., quote when the identifier contains spaces or is not a simple SQL identifier, or simply always quote table names/columns). The provided evidence also shows the failing agent added extra behavior (escaping quotes, broader keyword set, validation) and used a placeholder/empty reserved set—clear agent-side divergence that can explain failure without invoking a benchmark bug.

Alternative explanations: (1) Tests may only cover the specific listed keywords and spaces; implementing exactly that small list is a plausible, simple choice even without dialect discussion. (2) Tests may accept broader quoting (always quote) or different keyword handling; we are not shown the actual failing assertions.

Some evaluators argue this makes the task unanswerable or forces guesswork.

Why I doubt it: the evidence does not show an irrefutable benchmark defect that no agent could overcome. Even if the user simulator sometimes says “I don’t know,” the hidden snippet itself already provides a concrete, usable spec for at least the input datetime format (ISO-like with trailing Z). The rest (percent-encoding for OData query strings, DateTimeOffset formatting) is standard and can be implemented robustly without further user clarification (e.g., parse ISO8601, normalize to UTC, output ISO8601 with 'Z', then URL-encode via a standard library). The evaluation also contains an internal inconsistency: one run is marked as not failed, undermining the claim that the benchmark necessarily rejects valid solutions.

Alternative explanations: the agent may have (a) ignored the provided format string, (b) chosen an incorrect default, (c) implemented encoding incorrectly (e.g., encoding 'T'/'Z' when typical URL encoding would not), or (d) failed to match the test’s expected exact output.

Why I accept it: Two independent binary evaluations (3 and 5) cite concrete contradictions between (a) the hidden reference code and (b) the simulated user’s asserted spec. If the simulator is constrained to hidden info, it should not invent `created_at`/ID-return semantics absent from that code. This is not mere ambiguity; it is a direct mismatch between the only ground-truth (hidden code) and the dialogue-provided “requirements,” meaning an agent that follows the conversation can be forced away from the tested behavior.

Alternative explanations considered: Could the agent have ignored the user and reverse-engineered the hidden behavior? In this benchmark setup, the agent does not see the hidden code; it must rely on the simulated user. If the simulated user contradicts the hidden target, then success depends on distrusting the provided requirements and guessing the hidden implementation details—an unreasonable expectation and indicative of a formation defect (simulator not faithfully reflecting hidden info).

Also, even if one transcript omitted the default, a capable agent could ask a direct question (“What about other days?”) and obtain it; nothing indicates the user is unable/unwilling to reveal it.

Alternative explanations: The observed failure is readily explained by agent error (format/protocol violations and incorrect submission formatting), not by an evaluation harness rejecting valid solutions. The fact that one run passed despite a None-vs-0 discrepancy more plausibly indicates limited test coverage, not a benchmark impossibility.

Some evaluators argue the simulated user may not reliably reveal these constants, making the task unsolvable.

Why I doubt it’s an IFE: At least two runs explicitly report success (failed=false) and one evaluation states the agent elicited the exact constants/logic via questions. That directly refutes “no agent could overcome it.” The presence of “magic numbers” in a hidden solution is not, by itself, a benchmark defect; many benchmarks expect discovering specifics through clarification. The alleged unit mismatch is also not shown to be enforced in a contradictory way by the harness—an agent can still implement the exact expected comparisons regardless of physical realism.

Alternative explanation: The failing runs look like agent/dialogue failures—either the agent didn’t extract the needed constants, or the simulated user responses varied and the agent proceeded with invented heuristics. Variability in user answers across runs is not proven here to be a systematic harness defect; and the existence of successful runs indicates the information can be obtained and the task can be passed.

Alternative explanations: the agent simply followed the simulated user’s incorrect additions (e.g., +1 inclusive, extra validation) and thus diverged from the reference. A stronger agent could ignore unsupported constraints, ask a clarifying question about inclusivity, and default to standard datetime delta semantics, matching the reference.

Final determination: no overwhelming, irrefutable evidence of a benchmark/evaluation defect that prevents success; failures are plausibly agent-caused. Therefore grade 0."

Why I accept it: The evidence quotes the hidden reference code and shows the agent explicitly asking for the missing numeric anchors/slopes, while the simulated user answers they “don’t know” them. If the evaluation harness grades against that exact hidden piecewise function, then the task is intrinsically under-specified from the dialogue: multiple reasonable mappings satisfy “age and velocity affect distance,” but only one will match the hidden constants. With the user unable/unwilling to reveal the needed constants, an agent cannot reliably infer the unique expected implementation.

Alternative explanations considered: Could a better agent guess the exact constants? In principle, but that would be luck/memorization, not derivation from the prompt. The prompt itself (“I’m not sure how the age and velocity should affect the distance”) provides no constraints that single out those breakpoints and coefficients. This is not an agent coding error; it’s a specification/evaluation mismatch.

Why I accept it: The evidence includes concrete snippets of the hidden expected logic (space removal + zip char equality + threshold). That behavior is not a reasonable interpretation of “sounds similar”/pronunciation similarity; it is a different task (string alignment/overlap). Because the evaluator is keyed to this hidden heuristic, a solution that correctly targets phonetic similarity (as at least one agent did) will systematically fail despite being correct per spec.

Alternative explanations considered: Could the prompt have intended a crude textual similarity rather than phonetics? The wording and example strongly indicate phonetics/wordplay, not positional character equality after stripping spaces. Also, the hidden algorithm is arbitrary and under-specified; nothing in the prompt suggests zip-based matching against the target length. A sufficiently capable agent could guess many heuristics, but guessing this exact hidden rule is not reliably inferable from the description.

If the hidden snippet is available to the simulated user and the user is constrained to answer using it, then a sufficiently capable agent could ask directly for the exact conditional logic/thresholds/multipliers (e.g., “Please provide the exact rules/conditions from the hidden code for when to throttle and by what factors”). The evaluations assert the user “cannot convey” the thresholds as policy context, but provide no proof that the user would refuse if asked explicitly for the constants/conditions present in the snippet. The described failure mode (agent asked conceptual questions; user said “I don’t know”; agent invented defaults) is a classic agent-side elicitation/assumption error, not a demonstrated harness contradiction.

Alternative explanations: (1) The natural-language task likely underspecified the policy, and the intended solution is to query for the exact rule; the agent didn’t. (2) The user responses of “I don’t know” may have been triggered by vague questions; more precise questions could have extracted the exact piecewise function. (3) Even without dialogue, the task might have included enough description to implement the intended thresholds (not shown here).

Why I doubt it: ambiguity in the initial prompt is not, by itself, an intrinsic formation error if the intended behavior is recoverable via the simulated user/hidden reference. Here, the hidden reference implementation clearly defines the expected output as a tuple (average_time_per_puzzle, total_time). Another evaluation indicates the user did in fact clarify “average time per puzzle and total time taken,” which is sufficient for a capable agent to match the reference. The observed failure mode (reversed tuple order, extra empty-list behavior) is a straightforward agent implementation/format mismatch, not proof the benchmark would reject all valid solutions.

Alternative explanations: (1) The run that claims the user added extra requirements may be misattributing a particular transcript artifact; even if that happened, it doesn’t prove the harness is broken—agents can still follow the clarified requirement matching the reference. (2) A better agent could simply mirror the reference: compute sum, divide by total_puzzles, return (avg, total) with no extra special cases.

(2) Why I doubt it’s an IFE: A normalized weighted average is a standard, reasonable interpretation of “weighted average,” especially when weights “don’t necessarily have to sum to 1” (as one simulated user reply states). That statement actually points toward dividing by the sum of weights, not away from it. So a sufficiently capable agent could implement the normalized formula without needing extra hidden facts.

(3) Alternative explanations: The observed failures are readily explained by agent choices: one agent implemented an unnormalized weighted sum despite the user saying “weighted average” and weights may not sum to 1; another agent invented max-based normalization constants unrelated to the task. These are agent errors/overengineering, not proof the benchmark rejects valid solutions.

We are not shown the original full task prompt/spec, only an evaluator’s paraphrase and an alleged “hidden info shown in the transcript.” It’s plausible the prompt’s wording (“take into account”) is loose and does not require `federal_claim_presented` to affect the output in all cases (or at all), merely that it is an input.

Many coding benchmarks intentionally expect a specific simple formula even if it’s not physically rigorous. A sufficiently capable agent could (a) implement a minimal, assumption-based heuristic consistent with the prompt (“simple model”, “assume standard”, etc.), and (b) match the likely intended structure (quadratic in speed, increasing with magnitude of angles) without needing to know units. The fact that the exact coefficient is 0.01 is not proven to be undiscoverable or required by the prompt; it could be part of the original task statement (not shown here) or a conventional scaling in this benchmark suite.

Alternative explanations: The agent overcomplicated the solution by introducing extra parameters (rho, S, coefficients) and thus failed hidden tests that likely check for a specific deterministic function signature/output.

That alone is strong evidence the task is solvable within the benchmark setup and that the hidden-code-to-natural-language extraction is not inherently impossible or systematically broken.

Alternative explanations: The failing run in Evaluation 3 is plausibly due to that particular simulated user/model not following instructions well (or the agent not eliciting/using the info), not a benchmark defect.

Evaluation 1 reports the run succeeded and that the user did provide the complete actionable decision logic for all listed institution types (including the exact branches for lay_community/institution and hospital/non_exempt_religious_community). Evaluation 4 likewise indicates the user revealed key rule fragments and attributes failure to agent formatting/implementation mistakes, not missing information. This makes the “user intrinsically can’t extract hidden code” narrative non-irrefutable and likely run/agent-specific.

Alternative explanations: The failures described are plausibly agent-caused: (a) output formatting not matching the harness regex/code-block requirement, (b) adding unsupported fallbacks/labels (e.g., returning None) and guessing precedence rather than implementing the disclosed decision tree, (c) not returning the function in the required string/code-block format.

Another evaluator (Eval 5) notes a potential extraction weakness but also reports the run succeeded.

Why I doubt it: The evidence is not irrefutable that the benchmark is defective. At least one run (Eval 1) reports no failure and that the user did provide the key constants/mappings (availability/customization mapping, 1 admin per 20 servers, other_systems as list, sum change_frequency+change_volume, round up). Another run (Eval 5) explicitly says the task succeeded despite any simulator limitations. This directly undermines the claim that “no agent could overcome” the supposed issue.

Alternative explanations: The failing run in Eval 4 can be explained by agent-side errors: accepting inconsistent user answers without reconciling them, not inferring from context, or implementing a different formula (ceil, 0.10 factor) than what tests expect.

The hidden reference implementation fully specifies the required behavior (value membership vs identity check). A capable agent can implement the function correctly without any additional clarifications about types or error handling. Also, Evaluation 1 reports the run succeeded (failed: false) and the agent matched intended behavior, which strongly indicates the benchmark is solvable as-formed.

Here, the user-visible dialogue (per Evaluation 1 and 4) explicitly provides the exact service-name mapping the tests expect (Win2000 -> 'RunAs', WinXP -> 'Secondary Logon') and constrains dependencies to built-ins. That is sufficient for an agent to implement whatever check the benchmark expects (including a simplified one). Evaluation 4 itself concedes the agent could have implemented the expected logic but chose a different, more “realistic” approach.

Alternative explanations: The failure is readily explained by agent overengineering (registry/net start parsing) and/or using incorrect identifiers (e.g., 'RunAsSvc' vs 'RunAs'), not by an unsatisfiable or contradictory benchmark.

(2) Why I accept it: Multiple evaluations cite concrete hidden-reference evidence: `def calculate_total_fish(pouch_capacity, fish_per_dive, dives_per_flight): return pouch_capacity * dives_per_flight`. If true, that is not reasonably inferable from the prompt alone; it makes one parameter effectively a decoy. That is a benchmark formation defect (spec mismatch), not a mere agent mistake.

(3) Alternative explanations considered: It could be that the prompt explicitly says to ignore `fish_per_dive` or defines pouch_capacity as “fish per dive,” but the provided evidence indicates the prompt instead leaves the relationship unclear and even invites the natural formula `fish_per_dive * dives_per_flight` (or a min with capacity).

Tool mismatch: The `finish_answer` vs `final_answer` inconsistency is a real prompt defect, but evidence shows it is recoverable (agent switches to `final_answer` and can still pass). Since it does not definitively prevent a correct solution, it does not meet the “overwhelming, irrefutable” bar for an intrinsic formation error.

(2) Why I accept it: If the hidden tests are built around that reference, then any solution that faithfully follows the prompt by returning two values (onset + wear-off) would be rejected despite satisfying the stated requirement.

(3) Alternative explanations considered: It’s possible the prompt intended “kick in and wear off” colloquially to mean just total duration, but the wording strongly implies two times, and the reference code clearly implements only duration.

Why this is an IFE (and not just agent failure): If the simulated user is constrained to answer from hidden info, then responding “I don’t know” to direct questions about the cutoff and additional rules is inconsistent with the hidden spec. That makes the task under-specified from the agent’s perspective while the grader expects exact constants/strings. A capable agent could guess, but cannot reliably infer the exact threshold (1000) and exact string triggers (""hand of man"", prefix ""cDNA"") without being told; multiple plausible rules fit the prompt.

Alternative explanations considered: It’s possible the agent could have inferred the string rule from examples (cDNA_example, hand of man example).

Skeptical assessment: This is not irrefutable evidence of an intrinsic benchmark defect. Many coding benchmarks present an underspecified story but still expect implementing the provided/implicit formula; a capable agent could infer that the intended task is simply to implement the shown function (or ask and then proceed with the simplest plausible interpretation). The fact that one evaluator asserts the hidden solution is multiplicative does not prove the public prompt and tests are contradictory—only that an agent chose a different, more elaborate interpretation (normalization/weights) that likely mismatched tests (agent fault).

Alternative explanations: (1) The task is actually “implement calculate_emotional_bond as in the reference,” and the dialogue text is flavor; (2) The agent could have defaulted to the simplest formula without needing extra scale details; (3) Even if the simulated user can’t elaborate, that doesn’t prevent implementing the straightforward formula.

Crucially, the agent can still succeed by proposing assumptions and getting confirmation (as described), and another evaluation explicitly notes the run did not fail and the confirmed rules matched the hidden reference. That directly undermines the claim that “no agent could overcome” the issue.

Alternative explanations: The simulated user may be intentionally non-authoritative to force the agent to implement a reasonable combat simulation and/or to negotiate specs; or the evaluator is over-interpreting the hidden-code availability as something the simulated user must always disclose. Even if the user withheld details, a capable agent can implement robustly (e.g., ask for confirmation, handle edge cases like zero damage/infinite loops) and pass.

Skeptical assessment: This is not irrefutable evidence of a benchmark/evaluation defect. At most it shows one simulated-user dialogue introduced additional constraints beyond the hidden target.

Alternative explanations: (1) The agent overfit to user-added constraints and deviated from the reference; (2) Different runs show the simulated user can communicate the correct formula/rounding and the task passes (one run explicitly reports failed=false and alignment with the hidden reference).

Why I accept it: If the task is an interactive spec-elicitation setup, the only way an agent can be fairly graded is if the dialogue provides (or allows the agent to obtain) the exact decision boundaries/coefficients that the grader enforces. Here, the evidence indicates the user simulation does not reveal those constants and instead selects alternative assumptions (linear water factor, pH_min/pH_max) that contradict the hidden ground truth. That makes the required mapping underdetermined from the surfaced spec and even actively misdirected.

Alternative explanations considered: It could be agent failure if the dialogue actually contained the piecewise thresholds and the agent ignored them. But the provided evidence asserts the opposite: the user never communicates the 6 and 0 thresholds nor the 0.8/0.5 multipliers, and even says to use “reasonable defaults,” which cannot uniquely imply those exact constants. A stronger agent cannot reliably guess arbitrary hidden constants, especially when the simulated user endorses a different model.

Why I doubt it: This is not irrefutable evidence of a benchmark defect. Many programming benchmarks intentionally have a single intended interpretation even if the natural-language prompt is somewhat high-level. The evaluator’s argument hinges on the hidden solution being “arbitrary,” but provides no proof that the prompt cannot reasonably imply that interpretation (e.g., commission only on non-renewed/new policies; “number of customers per agent” used as a divisor to yield per-agent commission). Also, the agent’s alternative (adding renewals and computing number of agents via ceil) is itself a choice; a stronger agent could have asked more targeted questions or aligned with a simpler per-agent normalization.

Alternative explanations: (1) Agent misinterpreted renewal_rate (could represent fraction renewed, so non-renewed/new = policies*(1-renewal_rate)); (2) Agent overcomplicated “customers per agent” by converting to agent count rather than using it directly; (3) The benchmark may define policies as total customers/policies handled, so dividing by customers_per_agent is a straightforward per-agent scaling.

Final determination: Evidence is insufficiently conclusive to label this an intrinsic formation error. It’s plausible the task has a single intended formula and the agent simply chose a different one. Under the rubric’s high bar (“overwhelming, irrefutable”), this does not qualify."

Alternative explanations: A capable agent could write schema-flexible code (detect dict-with-'prices' vs list-of-dicts) and pass regardless of which schema the tests use.

Why I doubt it: This is not irrefutable evidence of a benchmark defect. The cited hidden code snippet is compatible with a common, coherent convention: `xp_required_per_level[level]` stores the incremental XP required to reach `level` from `level-1` (with index 0 unused or set to 0). Under that convention, summing indices `current_level+1..target_level` is exactly correct. The later “1-based incremental” guidance is not necessarily inconsistent with the hidden code; it can match perfectly if the list is sized with a dummy 0th element.

Alternative explanations: The failure can be entirely agent-side: the agent could choose and document a reasonable convention (e.g., index equals resulting level, xp[0]=0), implement accordingly, and pass. The simulated user’s initial uncertainty does not prove the task is impossible or that the harness rejects valid solutions; it just indicates the agent needed to make/confirm assumptions. Also, we only see one evaluator’s narrative and a single code line, not a demonstrated contradiction in the official prompt vs. tests.

Why I doubt it: This is not irrefutable evidence of a benchmark defect; it’s evidence that one agent chose a different smoothing heuristic after the user said they didn’t know. Many programming benchmarks intentionally require inferring the intended computation from the function signature, variable names, and typical patterns (e.g., Laplace/add-one smoothing). The presence of `+1` in the denominator is a common, guessable convention, not inherently “arbitrary.” Also, the alleged “dimensional inconsistency” of adding `num_ratings` to a weighted sum is speculative without the original problem statement; `num_ratings` could plausibly be a sum of rating values (not a count), in which case the formula is coherent.

Alternative explanations: A stronger agent could (a) ask for examples/expected outputs, (b) infer that `num_ratings` is likely total rating points, (c) implement the exact add-one smoothing form, or (d) implement a solution consistent with common smoothing and pass tests if the benchmark aligns with that intent.

Why I doubt it: This is based on a single evaluator’s assertion about “hidden info” and an inferred mismatch; we are not shown the actual benchmark prompt, the unit conventions, or the official tests.

Even if the reference uses fixed lists, that is not inherently an IFE: many benchmarks intentionally define a closed-world extraction task where the correct behavior is to match a known set of entities/sentiment tokens. A capable agent could still implement a robust extractor that (a) detects those entities when present, (b) outputs empty/None otherwise, and (c) uses exactly the required sentiment tokens (e.g., map synonyms to 'like'/'hate')—without needing the user to enumerate the lists.

Alternative explanations: the agent may have over-generalized with heuristics, used different output schema, failed to normalize sentiment to the expected labels, or missed exact token matching/casing rules. Any of these are standard agent failures, not benchmark defects.

Bottom line: there is no irrefutable proof of a contradiction or an evaluation harness that rejects valid solutions. With reasonable doubt and plausible agent-side failure modes, this does not meet the bar for an intrinsic formation error."

Many benchmark prompts are loosely worded but still have a canonical expected statistic; that alone is not an intrinsic defect. The evaluator’s evidence is not irrefutable: we don’t see the full original prompt, any explicit I/O examples, or the actual unit tests. It’s entirely plausible the prompt explicitly or implicitly indicates z-score (e.g., mentions “z-score”, “standard score”, or “standard deviations from normal”), in which case the agent’s probability-mapping via erf is simply wrong.

Alternative explanations: (1) The agent over-interpreted “likelihood” and invented a [0,1] mapping not requested. (2) The prompt may have specified z-score or a numeric score without bounding to [0,1]. (3) Even if wording is broad, a capable agent could choose the simplest conventional metric (z-score) and pass.

A capable agent can implement exactly that without needing any additional natural-language clarifications. Indeed, one run is reported as succeeding despite the unhelpful user, and another run’s failure is explicitly attributed to a tool/protocol formatting error (missing required code fence), not to missing/contradictory requirements.

Alternative explanations: agents that added extra validation/format-handling likely diverged from the expected simple reference behavior; that is an agent choice, not a benchmark defect.

Evaluators argue this rule is not inferable from the natural-language prompt and cannot be elicited because the simulated user is constrained to answer only from hidden info yet responds “I don’t know” to reasonable clarifications.

Why I accept it: The provided evidence includes the exact hidden function. Its key constants/conditions (level 50 cutoff; simple membership test 'mage' in group_comp; exact return strings including the fallback) are implementation details with no grounding in the described user intent. Under the stated user constraint (“only answer with hidden info, otherwise say you don’t know”), a capable agent cannot reliably derive the level-50 threshold or the exact outputs unless the user discloses them; but the transcript excerpts show the user does not disclose them and instead says “I don’t know” to questions that would be necessary to infer any such threshold. That makes matching the hidden tests essentially guesswork.

Alternative explanations considered: Could a better agent have guessed the exact rule? In principle yes, but that would be luck, not skill; the rubric for IFEs is about whether the benchmark demands non-derivable specifics. Here, the expected behavior is not a reasonable consequence of the prompt and is not obtainable through the allowed dialogue, so failure is attributable to benchmark formation (hidden, arbitrary spec) rather than agent capability.

We only have one evaluator’s narrative about “hidden code” semantics; we do not see the actual task prompt, tests, or full reference implementation.

Alternative explanations: a capable agent could implement input-normalization (accept both 0–1 fractions and 0–100 percentages by detecting scale, e.g., if sum(shares) <= 1.0+eps treat as fractions else treat as percents; similarly for eu_target). That would pass regardless of which convention the tests use, so the task is not provably impossible or contradictory in a way that “no agent could overcome.”

Why I doubt it: This is not irrefutable evidence of a benchmark/eval harness defect. Many coding benchmarks intentionally have a hidden target function; the task is to infer it via interaction. The evidence provided does not show that the simulated user was unable to reveal the needed constraints when asked clearly (e.g., “What are the exact allowed outputs?” “What exact weapon strings should be recognized?” “What should happen when uses_magic is false?”). Instead, the agent appears to have pursued an elaborate, domain-inspired model and accepted/introduced extra states and outputs. That is consistent with agent failure to elicit/adhere to the required discrete spec, not a provably impossible task.

Alternative explanations: A stronger agent could have (1) forced a crisp spec: enumerate all branches, exact return strings, and exact accepted weapon values; (2) implement exactly those literals and the fallback 'Not enough information'; (3) treat is_giant as boolean only.

Meanwhile, the natural-language task framing is about “mustache or beard style” and “how well each footballer did,” which strongly suggests `facial_hair` encodes styles and that performance metrics would be involved.

Why I accept it as an IFE (skeptically): The evidence includes an explicit snippet of the hidden code and a description that the simulated user is constrained to only reveal hidden info. If that hidden code is truly the target, then the benchmark’s expected behavior is not just underspecified—it is actively misleading relative to the prompt: interpreting `facial_hair` as styles (the only reasonable reading) will not match tests that interpret it as a set of names. This is not something a “better agent” can reliably infer from the prompt alone, because the correct behavior is arbitrary (name-membership filter) and contradicts the semantic meaning of the parameter and story.

Alternative explanations considered: (1) The agent could have asked clarifying questions and been told `facial_hair` is a list of names and output must be wrapped—however the evaluations indicate the simulated user could not provide such clarifications (only knows name/games_played, no examples), which would prevent convergence. (2) The agent could ignore the story and implement a minimal filter—yet there are many plausible minimal filters (by style key, by truthy facial_hair field, etc.); selecting “names contained in facial_hair” is not a reasonable default given the wording.

Why this is not irrefutable IFE: (1) The hidden code shown is itself sufficiently specific for a capable agent to infer the intended behavior without further dialogue: compute jobs_created = (initial_revenue * tax_rate_reduction) * jobs_per_million_dollars; revenue_change = -initial_revenue * tax_rate_reduction; spending_change = revenue_change * spending_rate; return exactly a 3-tuple in that order. The agent’s mismatch (returning 6 values, adding extra metrics) is an agent choice, not a benchmark impossibility. (2) One evaluation explicitly notes the run “did not fail” (metadata failed=false), undermining the claim that the setup prevents success. (3) The alleged ambiguity about interpreting tax_rate_reduction is not a contradiction: the reference uses it as a fraction multiplier; an agent can adopt that directly.

Alternative explanation: the benchmark is fine and expects the simple 3-output function; the failing agent over-engineered the API and deviated from the implied reference. A better agent could pass by mirroring the provided code.

It’s also plausible the spec wording “range … (10% - 30%)” is descriptive (typical/required minimum varies) rather than a hard upper bound; many lending contexts don’t disqualify higher downpayments. In that interpretation, the agent adding an upper bound is simply wrong, and the benchmark is consistent.

Even if the reference ignores one argument, that does not automatically create an impossible or contradictory task; many benchmarks include unused parameters or expect a specific internal mapping. A capable agent could still match the expected output by following the prompt more carefully (e.g., treating game_genres as a list of genre labels and using a fixed mapping if implied by examples) or by inferring expected behavior from tests.

Alternative explanations: (1) The agent simply misinterpreted the contract (treated game_genres as dict mapping game->genre) and added extra behavior ('Uncategorized') not requested. (2) The agent failed formatting requirements (not providing the raw python function string), which is clearly agent-caused. (3) The prompt may have implied a predefined mapping (e.g., “predefined genres” could refer to an internal set), making the hardcoded dict consistent.

It concludes no agent could satisfy both.

Why I doubt it: This is not irrefutable evidence of a benchmark defect; it’s evidence that one agent followed (possibly) misleading conversational guidance rather than inferring/aligning with the actual required contract. In these benchmarks, the correct target is the hidden tests/reference behavior, not necessarily the simulated user’s invented clarifications. A sufficiently capable agent could (a) ignore/discount inconsistent user-provided examples, (b) implement a more flexible function accepting both dicts and tuples, (c) avoid rounding/clamping and extra validation, and (d) match the reference output type (floats) while still handling tuple inputs. That would likely pass the hidden tests even if the user text was noisy.

Alternative explanations: The agent simply implemented the wrong interface/behavior (agent fault).

Many coding benchmarks intentionally leave domain specifics underspecified because the correct solution is to implement a function that ranks countries given provided trafficking_data (as the hidden snippet suggests). A capable agent could proceed by (a) defining “high rates” as the highest numeric values in the provided trafficking_data, (b) documenting assumptions, and (c) implementing the generic sorting/top-k behavior without needing an external data source. The fact that the simulated user said “I don’t know” does not prove the task is impossible; it may just mean the agent asked unnecessary questions instead of making reasonable assumptions consistent with the code-oriented hidden info.

Alternative explanations: The agent could have solved by treating trafficking_data as the authoritative input and returning the top 5 by rate; or by parameterizing the metric and not requiring user clarification.

Why I doubt it: In ColBench programming tasks, the actual objective is typically to implement the function matching the hidden reference behavior, not to truly personalize based on a real user’s finances. The presence of a complete reference implementation in hidden info strongly suggests the task is simply to code that logic. A capable agent could ignore the conversational framing and implement a reasonable deterministic algorithm from the prompt, and/or infer that the evaluation expects a specific algorithmic behavior (e.g., sorting and conditional reductions) rather than interactive data collection. The evaluator’s argument hinges on “no agent could infer the exact 0.1 threshold and 0.5 factor,” but that is not irrefutable evidence of a benchmark defect—it's evidence the agent didn’t match the hidden spec. Benchmarks often include such arbitrary constants; that’s not inherently contradictory or impossible.

Alternative explanations: The agent likely failed by (a) treating it as an interactive personalization task instead of a coding-to-spec task, and/or (b) not reverse-engineering/deriving the intended behavior from the prompt and typical benchmark patterns.

Why I doubt it: The hidden info (the code) actually *does* fully specify the behavior.

Alternative explanations: (1) The task is simply to implement the reference behavior; the agent over-engineered (urlparse, wildcards, different precedence/default). (2) The benchmark may intentionally test whether the agent follows the given reference snippet rather than inventing security policy. (3) Even if the prompt to the agent was ambiguous, many agents could choose the simplest interpretation consistent with typical unit tests (direct substring checks) and pass.

The provided evidence includes the hidden reference solution, which is straightforward (compute friends_invited * reward_per_friend, add bonus_amount once if friends_invited >= bonus_threshold).

Why I doubt it: this is based on a single run’s narrative about “hidden reference solution” behavior, without the actual user-facing task text, the unit tests, or any concrete contradiction (e.g., prompt explicitly requiring MET/weight-based calculation). Many benchmarks intentionally define a simplified deterministic formula (fixed rates + multipliers) and describe it in the prompt; the evaluator may simply be omitting that description. Also, even if the prompt said “standard estimates are fine,” that does not prove the benchmark is defective—benchmarks often require a specific “standard” they define.

Alternative explanations: (1) The prompt likely specified the exact constants/rules and the agent ignored them and used METs/weight instead (agent failure). (2) The prompt may have implied a simple fixed-rate scheme (e.g., per-minute calories by activity) and the agent overcomplicated it.

Meanwhile, the simulated user either (a) states they do not know the needed thresholds, or (b) gives contradictory guidance that changes the type/semantics of `door_layout` to an integer door count (>=4), which is incompatible with the hidden test expectation of a specific string.

Why this is an IFE: If the dialogue/oracle is the only way to learn the ground-truth constraints, but it withholds them (“I don’t know…”) despite them existing in the hidden solution, or actively contradicts them (string label vs integer count), then a correct solution is not reliably learnable from the task interaction. That is a benchmark formation defect: the evaluation expects specific constants/types that the task interface does not consistently permit the agent to infer.

Alternative explanations considered: It could be agent error if the user clearly and consistently specified the exact thresholds and the required `door_layout` value. But the provided evidence indicates the opposite: either missing disclosure of thresholds or contradictory instructions about `door_layout`’s type/value. Under those conditions, even a strong agent cannot guarantee matching the hidden exact string/thresholds.

Why I doubt it: none of the provided evidence includes the actual task prompt, the hidden reference code, the test expectations, or the full dialogue. The explanations quote snippets (e.g., `ideal_sizes = {'small': (4, 720), ...}`) but these are unverified assertions from the evaluator, not irrefutable proof. Also, even if the reference ignores `preferred_resolution`, that is not automatically an intrinsic defect unless the public spec *unambiguously* requires it to be used and the tests enforce the contradictory behavior. We cannot confirm that contradiction without the prompt/tests.

Alternative explanations: the agent may simply have implemented the wrong return type/logic relative to a clear spec (e.g., spec might have asked for a categorical mapping or fixed recommendations). The user saying ""I don't know"" about how to supply an argument could be irrelevant if the function signature was already specified. A stronger agent could potentially infer expected behavior from examples in the prompt (not shown here) or from unit tests (if visible in the environment).

Why I accept it: This is a direct, concrete mismatch between stated input types/units and what the evaluator’s reference solution would require. A correct implementation under the written spec (treating awards as an int count; treating sales as thousands) will systematically diverge from the hidden scoring (len(list) and //100000 on absolute units). This is not a “hard” problem; it’s contradictory requirements.

Alternative explanations considered: Could an agent guess the hidden structure anyway?

Why this is an IFE: If the benchmark’s ground-truth tests are based on the hidden reference implementation, then an agent that correctly follows the user’s confirmed requirements will necessarily fail those tests whenever the third condition matters. This is a direct contradiction between the interactive spec (user-confirmed) and the evaluation oracle (hidden code). That is not an agent mistake; it is an intrinsic task formation defect: the task cannot be satisfied while adhering to the user’s instructions.

Alternative explanations considered: (1) The agent could have “ignored the user” and implemented the hidden rule anyway—this would pass tests but violates the benchmark’s own instruction-following premise; the evaluation explicitly indicates the user confirmed ignoring the rule, so complying with the user is the intended success criterion.

That is not irrefutable proof the benchmark itself is impossible/contradictory; it could be an agent-run artifact, a misread of what the agent was supposed to do (e.g., follow user requirements rather than hidden code), or simply that the agent should have inferred/asked differently. We are not shown the actual task statement, the official evaluation contract, or that the tests require the hidden code behavior while the user is authoritative. Without that, it’s not provable that “no agent could succeed.” A sufficiently capable agent might (depending on the benchmark design) ignore the user’s speculative scaling, ask for concrete thresholds, or align to expected discrete scoring.

For (B), tool crashes are concrete, but the same evaluation explicitly says it did not cause a recorded failure (run marked failed:false). Also, a tool malfunction in one transcript is not enough to conclude the task is intrinsically broken for evaluation; it may be transient or isolated.

Alternative explanations: agent misunderstanding, poor questioning strategy, or the benchmark expecting adherence to user-provided requirements (making the hidden-code comparison irrelevant).

Why I doubt it: This is a single evaluator’s narrative without the actual task prompt, tests, or full reference implementation. Even if the rule is “weird,” weirdness alone is not an intrinsic formation error; benchmarks can encode arbitrary business logic. To call an IFE, we’d need proof the prompt contradicts this behavior or that the harness rejects valid interpretations. We don’t have that. It’s also plausible the prompt explicitly mentioned those denominations or a legal exception, or that the evaluator misread the condition/context.

Alternative explanations: The agent may simply have implemented the wrong spec (e.g., incorrect timeline for opposite-sex civil partnerships, incorrect handling of religious denomination), and the reference behavior could be consistent with the described requirements.

This behavior (magic threshold 40°F, magic outputs, ignoring dates beyond existence of any shadow) is not specified in the natural-language task.

Why I accept it: Two independent evaluations provide concrete evidence by quoting the hidden solution logic and showing it is not derivable from the prompt. If the task statement only says “predict days until spring using shadows and temperatures” (as described), there are infinitely many reasonable heuristics; expecting a specific 4-value mapping with a 40°F cutoff is effectively requiring guessing hidden constants. That is a benchmark-spec mismatch, not an agent mistake.

Alternative explanations considered: (1) The prompt might have explicitly stated the 40°F cutoff and the 42/34/21/14 mapping—if so, this would be agent failure. But the evaluators explicitly state the task is underdefined and the simulated user even says they don’t know thresholds, which is consistent with the constants being absent from the visible spec.

The hidden reference expects the function to return either an integer shelters_needed (when enough shelters) or the string 'Not enough shelters'. However, the simulated user conversation (which the agent must follow) first asks for a boolean “whether there are enough shelters,” and later explicitly requests a tuple return format (fits, capacity, needed). These return-type requirements are mutually exclusive with the hidden reference outputs.

Why I accept it: This is not a subtle edge case—it's a direct contradiction in required return type/format. If the harness grades against the hidden reference, any solution that follows the user’s final explicit instruction (tuple) will necessarily fail. Conversely, returning int/'Not enough shelters' would violate the user’s explicit request. There is no single implementation that can satisfy both simultaneously without conditional behavior keyed on hidden tests (which is not a reasonable expectation).

Alternative explanations considered: The agent could have ignored the user and matched the hidden reference, but that would be noncompliance with the task as presented in-run; the evaluation description indicates the user guidance is part of the benchmark interaction. A “better” agent cannot reconcile incompatible output contracts.

Final determination: Overwhelming evidence of an intrinsic benchmark defect (contradictory spec between user-facing requirements and hidden reference tests)."

Alternative explanations: (1) The task text may have clearly specified `keywords` as two strings and required `overall_sentiment`, and the agent deviated. (2) The “simulated user” clarifications may not be authoritative or may have been misread/incorrectly followed by the agent.

Alternative explanations: A more careful agent could (1) copy the provided mapping verbatim into the function, (2) match the exact sorting/tie-breaking implied by the reference (e.g., stable dict insertion order under sorted(key=get, reverse=True)), and (3) use the correct required tool call to submit.

Alternative explanations: (1) The benchmark mapping is an arbitrary lookup table that happens to include 30->a and 48->b but is not Set-1; then 65->'A' is consistent within that table.

Why I accept it as an IFE: This is not a mere agent mistake; it’s a mismatch between (a) what the tests require (a very specific, arbitrary formula) and (b) what can be reasonably inferred from the prompt + user answers. If the user is constrained to answer from hidden info, then failing to disclose the only decisive rule (the exact formula) makes the correct behavior undiscoverable via dialogue. Additionally, the user’s explicit guidance to ignore skill_points directly contradicts the hidden expected behavior, making the task internally inconsistent.

Alternative explanations considered: A stronger agent could guess many possible ways skill might affect affordability (additive, multiplicative, thresholds, etc.), but there is no principled way to select exactly `budget // (skill_points * player_cost)`—especially when the user explicitly says to assume skill_points does not affect the calculation.

Why I doubt it: This is not irrefutable evidence of a benchmark/evaluation defect. Many coding benchmarks intentionally provide incomplete natural-language specs and rely on the agent inferring behavior from the prompt (or implementing a reasonable interpretation). The fact that a hidden reference implementation exists and the user refuses to reveal it does not by itself make the task impossible or contradictory; it just means the agent must implement based on the stated requirements. The evaluator’s argument hinges on an assumption that the only way to succeed is to extract exact hidden constants/operations via dialogue, but we are not shown the original task prompt/spec to establish that those details were truly unrecoverable or that the benchmark required an exact match beyond reasonable spec.

Alternative explanations: (1) The agent simply implemented the wrong logic/structure relative to a clear prompt. (2) The prompt may have specified enough (e.g., sentence_ranges as a list of numbers; return a numeric expected sentence) and the agent overcomplicated it (dict-of-tuples, arbitrary 30% reduction). (3) A stronger agent could implement a robust solution matching typical interpretations (e.g., accept iterable of numbers, compute min/sum-based outcomes) without needing the simulated user to disclose the hidden code.

However, the interactive task’s simulated user responses (per the evaluations) do not reveal these thresholds or point increments; instead the user says they don’t know scales/weights and accepts agent-suggested weighting schemes that are incompatible with the hidden code.

Why this is an IFE (and not agent fault): If the benchmark’s tests require implementing that exact threshold logic, then the only way to succeed is to obtain those constants/structure from the user or from the prompt. The evidence provided includes the exact hidden reference code and shows the user dialogue failing to disclose any of the required thresholds/increments, even contradicting them by endorsing a weighted-average approach. Under the stated constraint that the user only answers from hidden info and otherwise says “I don’t know,” the user’s behavior is inconsistent with the hidden info being accessible, making the correct solution not reliably recoverable from the interaction.

Alternative explanations considered: A stronger agent could try to guess a threshold-based scheme, but there is no principled way to guess the specific cutoffs (7,6,5,6) and point values (2,2,1,1) from the natural-language task; many plausible rubrics exist. Without the user revealing the exact rule, passing hidden tests would be essentially luck. This points to a benchmark formation defect: required implementation details are not provided/elicitable.

Why I doubt it: This is not irrefutable evidence of a benchmark defect; it’s a single evaluator’s assertion about hidden code and test alignment, without the actual task prompt, test cases, or harness behavior. Even if the reference uses those keywords, that does not prove the benchmark is impossible or contradictory—many benchmarks intentionally have a specific intended heuristic, and a capable agent could choose a minimal, definition-aligned keyword approach (e.g., focusing on “current/now/can” vs “latent/potential/innate”) rather than inventing broad synonyms. The agent’s broader keyword list could easily cause misclassifications on edge cases, which is an agent design choice, not necessarily an evaluation bug.

Alternative explanations: (1) The original prompt may have included those exact keywords or examples (not shown here). (2) The tests may include those words prominently, making the intended solution inferable from the definition (“current” vs “latent/potential”).

Why I doubt it: The evidence does not show an irrefutable benchmark defect—only that in some runs the simulated user gave unhelpful or vague answers. That is not proof the task is impossible or that the harness rejects valid solutions. A capable agent could (a) ask more targeted questions (e.g., “Is there any misdemeanor_type condition when rehab is false?” “Is the threshold strictly greater than 5 or at least 5?”), (b) infer a minimal conservative implementation consistent with the user’s stated intent (rehab => eligible; otherwise only after a long period and possibly only for non-violent), or (c) implement the simplest rule and iterate if tests fail. Nothing here proves the user is systematically prevented from disclosing the needed condition; it only shows one transcript where the user initially said “I don’t know” and later provided partial parameters.

Alternative explanations: The failures are plausibly agent-side—agents invented extra policy tables and used >= instead of >, and/or ignored the possibility of a misdemeanor_type gate. Also, one evaluation explicitly notes the run did not fail, undermining the claim that the benchmark formation necessarily blocks success.

Why I doubt it: The evidence provided is second-hand and incomplete. We are not shown the actual prompt, the full dialogue, the exact hidden tests, or the simulator’s full responses—only an evaluator’s narrative. It’s plausible the simulator said “I don’t know categories” while still providing enough functional requirements elsewhere (or the agent could have asked differently). Also, even if constants exist in hidden code, many benchmarks do not require matching those exact literals; tests may accept broader interpretations (e.g., any iterable diet/lifestyle, any race string) or focus on behavior rather than exact schema.

Alternative explanations: The agent may have overfit to invented validation/scoring and changed return shape (always returning all diseases, different label set), which is a common agent failure even when requirements are clear (e.g., “return only triggered risks” vs “return all”). A stronger agent could implement a minimal, permissive rule-based function without strict validation and with flexible handling of diet/lifestyle containers, potentially passing tests even without knowing exact category lists.

Evaluation 4 explicitly notes a capable agent could have asked for the exact equations and then implemented them, meaning the task is solvable within the intended protocol. That defeats the “no agent could overcome” bar required for an intrinsic formation error.

Alternative explanations: The failing run is readily explained by agent behavior—accepting/creating a heuristic instead of requesting the exact required formulas. The alleged simulated-user inconsistency (Evaluation 5) is not shown to cause failure (that run reportedly succeeded), and without the actual dialogue transcript it’s not irrefutable that the user refused to provide the needed formulas when asked.

Why I doubt an IFE: There is no irrefutable evidence that the benchmark would reject a correct solution. The hidden reference is straightforward (0.4/0.3/0.3 weighted sum). The described parsing/regex error is consistent with the agent not following the required submission/tool protocol, not with the benchmark being unable to accept valid code.

Alternative explanations: A competent agent that outputs exactly the expected function (no extra validation/behavior, correct interface, correct tool) would likely pass. The “simulated user” providing the weights indicates the task is solvable and not contradictory.

The reported failures include (a) not matching the required code-block/regex extraction format and (b) changing the formula (e.g., making weight/price negative, normalization) despite the user/hidden reference already specifying the exact expected computation and cutoffs. Those are agent errors, not benchmark defects.

Alternative explanations considered: If the harness regex were impossibly strict or contradictory, we’d expect evidence that a correctly formatted solution is still rejected.

Alternative explanations: (1) the prompt actually specified the exact formula/normalizations and the agent ignored/misread it; (2) the benchmark expects a simple linear scoring model and the agent overcomplicated it; (3) the evaluator inferred the hidden solution from a leak/log that may not reflect the real grading harness.

(2) Modulo cycling for length mismatch may be a reasonable implied interpretation of “cyclically”/“corresponding by index” depending on the original prompt wording, which we do not have here. The evidence provided does not include the actual task prompt, so we cannot establish that cycling is truly unstated or that tests cover mismatch cases. (3) The “simulated user” dialogue is not proof the benchmark is defective; many benchmarks don’t guarantee interactive clarification, and an agent can choose a robust behavior (e.g., raise on mismatch, document assumptions, or implement cycling + overwrite) that could match hidden tests.

Alternative explanations: the agent simply chose a different but plausible policy (zip/truncate or accumulate lists) and failed hidden tests that expect dict semantics (single value per key) and/or cycling. A stronger agent could infer dict overwrite semantics and implement cycling defensively.

Why I accept it as an IFE: This is arbitrary, exact-string behavior that is not stated or reasonably inferable from the user-facing prompt (“translate … like NYC government communications”). A competent agent implementing any genuine translation approach (offline dictionary, library, or API) would almost surely fail exact-match tests against these prefixes and the specific fallback string. The mismatch is not a subtle edge case; it’s a fundamentally different specification (labeling vs translating) with hidden constants.

Alternative explanations considered: Could the prompt have implied “just label the language” or “only support es/fr/en with these exact outputs”? No—nothing in the provided description suggests fixed English prefixes or the exact fallback 'Unsupported language'. Could an agent guess it?

Why I doubt it: This is not irrefutable evidence of an intrinsic benchmark defect. Many coding benchmarks intentionally provide only a prompt (no interactive clarification) and expect the agent to infer conventional behavior from the task statement. If the original prompt specified the behavior (e.g., “return involvement levels for suspects with evidence” or “for each suspect in the list”), then the agent’s choice could simply be wrong. Even without clarification, a capable agent could choose the more typical/safer interpretation (often: only include keys present in evidence, matching the reference loop) or mirror common reference patterns.

Alternative explanations: (1) The task statement likely already disambiguates missing-suspect handling; the agent missed it. (2) The evaluation harness may accept either behavior (e.g., compares only for suspects with evidence), so the failure could be due to other bugs. (3) The ‘user model’ being unhelpful is not itself a formation error unless the benchmark explicitly requires interactive requirement discovery; nothing here proves that.

Why I doubt it: This is a single evaluator’s narrative with an unverified snippet of “hidden info code.” We are not shown the actual task prompt/spec, the full reference implementation, or failing test cases demonstrating that correct, reasonable implementations are rejected.

Alternative explanations: A capable agent could match the expected behavior if the prompt actually describes symptoms as names/strings, or if the intended logic is key-based membership (which is common for dicts). Even if the reference has quirks, without concrete evidence that the harness enforces an impossible/contradictory requirement, this remains speculative.

Even if the simulated user is unhelpful or inconsistent, a capable agent could still (a) implement the simplest interpretation consistent with the hidden code (a dict mapping recipe->ingredient list; filtering by all ingredients present; diet restrictions as exclusion if restriction string appears), or (b) ask clarifying questions and then choose a conservative implementation aligned with typical unit tests (don’t invent new schema; keep to minimal fields). The evaluations describe agent behavior that invented a new schema and logic; that is plausibly agent error rather than a harness defect.

Alternative explanations: The “I don’t know” responses could be from a particular run’s simulated user behavior, not a guaranteed property of the task. Also, the alleged contradiction (user wants to extend schema vs hidden code) is not proven to be enforced by the benchmark; it could be optional product discussion while tests still target the original function behavior.

Why I doubt it: A hidden reference implementation being code-only is normal for coding benchmarks; the task is to infer/implement behavior, not to receive extra clarifications from a simulator. The reference code itself strongly implies the data types and contract: `schema.keys()`/`entry.keys()`/`entry.items()` indicates dict-like mappings; the boolean expression indicates the function returns a boolean; and the logic indicates the intended semantics (no extra keys in entry; for keys present in schema, values must equal schema’s value). A sufficiently capable agent could implement exactly that without any additional user clarification.

Alternative explanations: The agent likely over-engineered (returning (bool, errors), adding regex/range support, etc.) and diverged from the simple reference behavior. That is an agent failure, not a benchmark defect. Even if the prompt allowed multiple interpretations, the existence of a clear, minimal, implementable interpretation matching the hidden code means it’s not “provably impossible” or “definitively ambiguous” in the IFE sense.

It’s plausible the original task *did* specify MD5, dict stringification, or an exact algorithm/format (common in coding benchmarks), and the agent simply deviated. Also, even if the prompt only said “unique identifier,” benchmarks often implicitly require matching a specific reference implementation; that’s not automatically an intrinsic defect unless the spec truly leaves it unconstrained.

Alternative explanations: (1) The prompt required MD5 specifically. (2) The prompt required hashing the full stats dict (not a subset like country/locale/age range). (3) The prompt required stable reproduction of an existing system’s ID generation (where md5(str(dict)) is the intended behavior). Any of these would make the failure agent-caused.

The simulated user, despite allegedly having this hidden info, answers that they do not know the rule/threshold.

Why I accept it: If the evaluation is truly keyed to that exact algorithm/threshold, then the natural-language task is under-specified: there are many plausible interpretations of “tau spread” (graph propagation, thresholding raw tau values, diffusion, etc.). A max/2 cutoff on an endpoint-summed distribution is not inferable from the prompt and is not a standard default. The evidence presented is concrete: it quotes the hidden-code logic and contrasts it with the user’s inability to provide the needed specifics when asked.

Alternative explanations considered: (1) The agent could guess the exact max/2 rule—possible but not reasonably expected; success would be luck, not capability. (2) The prompt might have included more detail not shown here—however the evaluation explicitly argues the key rule is absent and the user denies knowing it. (3) The agent might still pass with a different but equivalent method—unlikely if tests check exact region set from that specific thresholding.

Why I doubt it: This is not irrefutable evidence of an intrinsic benchmark defect.

The fact that the simulated user says “I don’t know” about unspecified edge cases does not prove the evaluation includes those edge cases or that requirements are contradictory/impossible.

A stronger agent could simply implement the minimal reference behavior (zip+sum) without extra checks and pass.

Why this is an IFE: This is a direct, concrete mismatch between the only available specification (dialogue) and the evaluation target (hidden solution/tests). If the user explicitly instructs “majority of districts” and “return minimum needed to win,” then a correct solution under that spec will not, in general, equal `sum(winning_votes_per_district)` (which corresponds to winning *all* districts, or at least summing all thresholds regardless of majority). Conversely, an agent that simply returns `sum(winning_votes_per_district)` would be unjustifiable from the dialogue and could be penalized by any tests aligned with the dialogue. The evidence includes the exact hidden code and the contradictory user clarifications.

Alternative explanations considered: Could the agent have inferred that the true goal was summing all per-district thresholds despite the dialogue? That would require ignoring explicit clarifications, and there’s no reasonable way to reconcile “majority of districts” with “sum all districts’ thresholds” as a general rule. Could a better agent workaround by asking questions? In these benchmarks, the agent is constrained by the provided dialogue; if the dialogue is wrong relative to the hidden tests, asking won’t fix the misalignment.

Why I doubt it: This is not irrefutable evidence of a benchmark defect. The task, as reconstructed, appears to be a straightforward function-implementation problem with an explicit signature including `default_brightness`, `min_brightness`, and `max_brightness`. A capable agent could reasonably choose to implement a simple, OS-agnostic arithmetic mapping and clamping without needing OS/sensor-unit details, and could also plausibly anchor the mapping at `default_brightness` (since that parameter’s presence strongly suggests it should be used as the baseline). The cited failure modes (assuming min→max interpolation, importing external brightness-control libraries, asking irrelevant OS questions) are agent choices, not proof that the benchmark would reject all reasonable solutions.

Alternative explanations: (1) The agent simply implemented the wrong formula despite the parameter names hinting at the intended one. (2) The agent overfit to the “personalized” framing and went off into OS/library control rather than implementing the pure function likely required by tests. (3) Even if the prompt is somewhat underspecified, it’s still solvable by selecting the most semantically consistent interpretation (use `default_brightness` as baseline, clamp to [min,max]).

We are not shown the actual task statement, the real unit tests, or any concrete failing cases demonstrating that a spec-compliant solution is necessarily rejected.

Alternative explanations: (1) Agent over-engineered behavior not requested (filtering/None) and failed tests expecting a straightforward average. (2) The prompt may have been unambiguous about single numeric ratings, making the agent wrong. (3) Even if the prompt mentioned “multiple ratings,” a capable agent could still match tests by interpreting that as multiple reviews rather than multiple values per review, or by implementing in a way compatible with both (e.g., accept scalar or list and flatten), so it’s not proven “no agent could overcome.”

Why I doubt this is an IFE: The only concrete evidence is an error message about a missing ```python```-style code fence. That is not an intrinsic impossibility; it is a standard formatting requirement that a capable agent can satisfy by outputting code in the expected fenced block. There is no proof the harness rejects valid fenced code, only that it rejects prose.

The ambiguity claim also does not rise to an intrinsic benchmark defect: many benchmarks have underspecified edge cases, but a sufficiently capable agent can (i) ask clarifying questions, (ii) follow the most conventional interpretation, or (iii) match typical reference behavior. The evaluations themselves indicate the hidden/reference solution is simple and achievable, and that the agent failed by adding extra behaviors (tie returns, extra validations/exceptions) that diverged from expected outputs.

There is no evidence the prompt *requires* `program_duration` to affect the result, nor evidence the harness rejects any reasonable interpretation. The more concrete mismatch described is agent-side: the agent excluded missing/non-numeric/non-finite records, while the reference counts all patients in the denominator and directly indexes required keys. That is a solvable alignment issue, not an intrinsic impossibility.

Alternative explanations: A sufficiently careful agent could follow the stated/elicited rule “every patient ... part of the denominator” and implement the minimal reference behavior (no skipping/validation, or at least denominator = len(patient_data)).

One evaluator asserts this mismatch makes the task underdefined and thus an intrinsic benchmark defect.

Why I doubt it: This is not irrefutable evidence of an IFE. The prompt (as relayed) is short and could reasonably be interpreted as “count how many modules have dependency info” given the user hint that each module “might have a 'dependency' or 'dependencies' key” and no examples. In many data-cleaning tasks, “count dependencies” can mean counting dependent modules/records rather than summing list lengths. A capable agent could choose the simpler, more robust interpretation aligned with the hinted keys: count modules where either key is present/truthy. The alleged hidden solution is also plausible and not self-contradictory.

Alternative explanations: The agent likely over-assumed the structure (lists of dependencies) and implemented a different metric; that’s an agent interpretation error, not a harness defect. Without the full original prompt and tests, we cannot prove the benchmark rejects all reasonable solutions or that the requirement is impossible/contradictory.

The task as described (compute years until next sighting; return 0 if divisible) is internally consistent and matches the reference formula. If tests include edge cases like negative years or zero frequency, the agent’s added exceptions could indeed fail—but that is an agent choice, not a benchmark defect.

Alternative explanations: A sufficiently capable agent could simply implement the reference expression `(freq - (year % freq)) % freq` (or equivalent without raising) and pass. Even if edge cases exist, matching the intended behavior is feasible.

Why I doubt it: This is not irrefutable evidence of a benchmark defect. A task like “analyze emotion level such as hope/strength” can reasonably be implemented as counting occurrences of the provided emotion string and normalizing by word count; that’s a plausible, simple interpretation. The fact that an agent chose a richer lexicon/tokenization approach and failed does not prove the benchmark is contradictory or impossible—just that the agent didn’t match the expected spec.

Alternative explanations: (1) The natural-language task may have explicitly asked for counting the given emotion term (not synonyms), making the reference correct. (2) Even if the prompt mentioned “keyword lists,” a capable agent could still implement the exact expected behavior by treating the “keyword list” as just the single provided emotion, or by asking clarifying questions / aligning to minimal behavior. (3) The whitespace-only edge case is a minor quirk, not evidence that no valid solution can pass; agents can replicate it if needed.

The failures described are classic agent-side mismatches (AND vs OR, > vs >=, omitting “hypnotic”, not computing similarity_score), not an evaluation harness rejecting valid solutions or an impossible/contradictory spec.

The simulated user is supposed to only reveal hidden-code facts, but in the dialogue the user explicitly withholds/denies knowing the baseline values and thresholds.

Why this is an IFE: If the public task prompt is open-ended (“perfect” slashing angle/depth) and the user does not provide the exact constants/branching rules that the tests require, then the problem is underdetermined from the agent’s available information.

Why I accept it (skeptically): This is strong, concrete evidence of a spec–tests mismatch. The required return type (boolean) and the magic literal requirement (tripod_type must equal exactly 'sturdy') are not entailed by the narrative prompt. A reasonable interpretation of “suggest the optimal approach” is to return advice (string/dict) or at least a recommendation, not a boolean gate. Even if an agent chose to return a boolean, the exact sentinel string 'sturdy' (vs 'heavy', 'solid', etc.) is arbitrary and not inferable from the prompt.

Alternative explanations considered: Could a better agent guess the hidden predicate? Only by luck or by ignoring the prompt and implementing an arbitrary boolean check. The dialogue constraint (simulated user can only answer from hidden info) further prevents eliciting any additional clarifying requirements beyond the hidden code, and the prompt itself doesn’t provide those requirements.

Without the original problem statement, it’s not provable that returning a boolean (or early-failing on missing champions) contradicts requirements; those behaviors could be consistent with a task like “check whether any winnings would be earned” or “validate bracket completeness before checking winnings.” Also, the claim that key inputs are unused could be an artifact of a partial snippet or a simplified reference that still matches tests.

Alternative explanations: (1) The agent may have over-interpreted the task and implemented a payout distribution when the task only asked for a boolean.

Why I doubt it: This is a single evaluator’s narrative without the actual task prompt, full dialogue, tests, or the hidden code shown verbatim in context. It’s plausible the agent simply overfit to its own interpretation of “quanto adjustment” and asked leading questions; the “simulated user” answers could be part of the benchmark spec, and the hidden code snippet could be misread/misattributed. Also, even if the hidden solution is code-only, that is normal for benchmarks; it’s not automatically an IFE unless the public spec is genuinely contradictory/impossible.

Alternative explanations: (1) The task likely intended implementing exactly the provided formula (or a simplified toy ‘quanto adjustment’) and the agent deviated into full Black–Scholes pricing.

The remaining discrepancy (case sensitivity and split-vs-regex tokenization) is a normal spec-interpretation/implementation choice, not proof the benchmark is impossible or contradictory.

Why I doubt it rises to an IFE: (1) Hidden tests using specific constants is normal; unless the prompt makes those constants unknowable or contradictory, this is not a benchmark defect. The evaluations themselves indicate the simulated user can provide the constants (90 degrees, 9.9 cm, 12 cm), so a capable agent could match them. (2) The garment-type requirement is not proven contradictory: an agent could implement exemptions without changing the signature (e.g., internal list, optional parameter with default, or separate helper) and still satisfy tests.

(3) One evaluation explicitly reports the run succeeded (failed=false), which strongly suggests the task is solvable within the benchmark as-is.

Alternative explanations: the failing agent overfit to conversational guidance to change the signature; a better agent would keep the required signature and implement the numeric rules exactly as given by the user, passing tests.

The evaluation itself notes the agent actually extracted the correct core rule (min(max_sets, num_backups - num_to_archive)), so the supposed formation issue did not prevent success.

Alternative explanation: The failures are readily attributable to agent-side deviations from the expected simple function: adding extra clamping/type checks and/or output formatting issues (e.g., including an extra leading ""python"" token in the returned code block) that could break strict tests.

Also, the conflicting evaluations suggest the “fabricated schema details” are not clearly established as unavoidable; another evaluator argues the sim-user can provide actionable mapping details and a better agent could align to the mapping.

The public task description reportedly asks more generally to infer age/role demographics from witness descriptions, without specifying these exact triggers or the 'unknown' key/tuple return.

(2) Why I accept it as an IFE: If the oracle truly checks for those exact phrases/structure, then many reasonable implementations that satisfy the natural-language spec (synonyms, broader heuristics, different but sensible output structure) will be marked wrong. That is a benchmark defect: the evaluation is enforcing hidden, arbitrary constraints not derivable from the stated requirements.

(3) Alternative explanations considered: It could be agent failure if the prompt clearly specified the exact keywords, the 'unknown' bucket, and the tuple-of-dicts return.

Alternative explanations: (1) The agent misread/ignored prompt requirements about claimants being a collection.

Why I accept it: If the public prompt truly only says “calculate total greenhouse gas emissions from various sources” with parameter names and no factors/units, then there is no principled way for an agent to infer the exact five constants the tests expect.

Why I doubt it: This is not irrefutable evidence of a benchmark defect.

The alleged “impossibility” hinges on the agent choosing to ask schema questions and then overfitting to the narrative; but nothing shown proves the public task statement is contradictory or that the harness rejects reasonable solutions. Also, the hidden code itself is perfectly implementable; the fact that the simulated user can’t explain it in natural language is not automatically an IFE unless the task *requires* interactive requirement elicitation to succeed.

(2) Agent chose to design a reasonable heuristic instead of matching the hidden function. (3) The simulated user may have been able to provide the exact code logic if prompted.

Final determination: The evaluations show agent–reference mismatch, not a proven evaluation harness bug, contradiction, or unsatisfiable spec. With reasonable doubt and no concrete proof that no agent could succeed, this is not an IFE."

Why I doubt it: Underdefinition about ranges does not imply an intrinsic benchmark defect. A perfectly reasonable interpretation is that inputs are already on compatible scales and should be used directly; many benchmark tasks expect exactly that. The agent’s choice to introduce normalization/clamping and assumed ranges is an avoidable design decision, not something forced by the prompt. A stronger agent could simply implement the straightforward weighted sum (including the inversion term if described) without normalization and likely match the hidden solution.

Alternative explanations: (1) The prompt likely described the formula qualitatively enough (weights and inversion) and the agent deviated. (2) Even if ranges are unknown, the safest approach for matching typical unit tests is to avoid extra transformations and implement the simplest direct computation.

Evidence threshold: Only one evaluator asserts hidden constants and concludes “no agent can infer.” That’s not irrefutable—constants/structure could have been inferable from the prompt, and the failure can be explained by agent-added behavior. Therefore, no overwhelming proof of a benchmark/evaluation defect."

Meanwhile, the simulated user (who is supposed to answer based on hidden info) reportedly told the agent to return a 2-D list and to interpret `dot_size` as square blocks with `gap` as spacing between dot edges.

Why I accept it as an IFE: If the simulated user indeed provided those contradictory requirements, then an agent that follows the user’s clarifications cannot simultaneously match the hidden tests. This is not a mere underspecification; it is a direct contradiction on core I/O contract (data structure) and parameter semantics (`dot_size` used vs unused). No amount of agent skill can satisfy both.

Alternative explanations considered: (1) The evaluator could be misreporting the hidden reference or the user’s statements. But the evidence quoted includes concrete code-level details (dict rows, modulo rule, dot_size unused) and specific contradictory user quotes. (2) A strong agent could ignore the user and guess the hidden behavior—but that would require disregarding explicit user requirements, which is not a reasonable expectation for the benchmark.

The only strong IFE claim (6) hinges on an asserted mismatch between “hidden reference” and “dialogue,” but we are not shown the actual full prompt/transcript or the hidden tests—only secondhand summaries.

Alternative explanations: (1) The agent could have asked clarifying questions and implemented a robust solution supporting both list-of-dicts and dict-of-dicts, avoiding schema sensitivity. (2) The failure could be purely due to output-format/tooling noncompliance (as evaluation 4 states), which is agent fault. (3) The alleged schema inconsistency may be an evaluator misread; phrases like “identified by their name” are compatible with dict keys, not necessarily a list-of-dicts.

Why I accept it: The evidence includes the hidden spec itself (a concrete function definition) and quotes showing the simulator denying knowledge of parameters/behavior that are explicitly encoded there. If the public prompt does not state 0.89 or the 2012 exception, then a correct implementation cannot be inferred from the task statement alone; the only intended channel is the simulated user, which in these runs fails to disclose the necessary constants/logic. That is a direct benchmark formation defect: the oracle has the answer but refuses to provide it under its own “answer only from hidden info” rule.

Alternative explanations considered: Could a better agent have succeeded by asking more directly (e.g., “Is there a baseline share constant?” “Any special-case years?”). Possibly in some setups, but the provided transcript evidence shows the simulator categorically claiming not to have baseline percentages or economy_impact treatment, which contradicts the hidden code. When the oracle denies having the needed info, no agent can reliably recover the exact magic constant and branch required by hidden tests.

The agent’s implementation explicitly *ignored* the `specs` argument and hard-coded a spec list, which is a clear agent error under almost any plausible spec.

Alternative explanations: the benchmark could be perfectly fine and simply checks that the function uses the `specs` parameter and returns a dict keyed by those specs with comparable values (likely booleans).

Why I doubt it’s an intrinsic benchmark defect: This is not irrefutable evidence that the benchmark is impossible or that the harness rejects valid solutions. It’s consistent with the agent (or simulated user) choosing an incorrect default in an underspecified situation. A capable agent could avoid this by returning the full dict (the most natural interpretation of “device” given list of dicts), or by matching typical benchmark expectations (return the element, not a field). Underspecification alone is not a proven IFE unless it can be shown that multiple reasonable interpretations are accepted in the prompt but the grader enforces a different one in a way no agent can infer.

Key alternative explanation: The benchmark likely expects returning the dict (as the reference indicates), and the agent simply implemented the wrong return type after an ungrounded assumption. Also, the provided evidence even notes the run did not fail, undermining causality.

Why I doubt it: The evidence is not irrefutable. Another evaluation (o3 non-binary) explicitly shows the user *did* provide sufficient clarifications (matches is a list of dicts with 'team'/'result', results are 'win'/'draw', scoring 3/1, ignore teams not in teams) and the run is reported as not failed. That directly undermines the claim that the user cannot communicate necessary requirements. Also, the “regex pattern not found” parsing error is not demonstrated as an unavoidable harness defect; it could be triggered by the agent not following the required code-output format (common in these benchmarks) rather than the benchmark rejecting valid solutions.

Alternative explanations: (1) Agent formatting/packaging error caused the regex parse failure. (2) The binary evaluator’s speculation about mismatch despite “same core logic” could be wrong; subtle differences (e.g., handling missing keys, case sensitivity, return type, mutation) can fail tests. (3) The run marked failed may be due to interaction/tooling misuse by the agent, not an intrinsic benchmark contradiction.

Why I doubt it’s an intrinsic benchmark defect: This is not evidence of a broken evaluation harness or contradictory requirements; it’s evidence that the agent is expected to infer the true spec from the dialogue/hidden rule, and at least one run reportedly succeeded despite the same setup (Evaluation 1 notes the run passed). That alone creates reasonable doubt that “no agent could overcome” the situation. A capable agent could also choose to implement a more general rule (e.g., handle both 'soldier' substring and the 'military'/age logic) or probe inconsistencies and hedge, potentially matching the hidden tests.

Alternative explanations: (1) The failing agents over-trusted the user’s natural-language statements and didn’t attempt to reconcile with likely hidden constraints; (2) The benchmark may accept multiple implementations or have limited tests such that even an imperfect rule can pass (as suggested by the successful run), meaning the setup is solvable.

Why I doubt it: This is not irrefutable evidence of a benchmark defect. The harness requirement (a fenced code block) is a standard, satisfiable output format; an agent can comply by placing the function inside a proper ```python ...``` block in the final response.

Also, Evaluation 1 reports a successful run (failed=false) on the same task, which strongly indicates the task is solvable under the benchmark’s formatting constraints.

Here, the reference behavior (return a dict keyed by caller/receiver with encryption status) is a plausible interpretation of “output the logs that identify whether each call is encrypted or non-encrypted.” The “anonymize” wording could reasonably mean “treat calls involving anonymous parties as encrypted/anonymous,” not necessarily “hash/mask strings.”

Key counterevidence: At least two runs are reported as not failing (metadata “failed: false”) despite allegedly returning very different structures (list of dicts with masking/hashing). That strongly suggests either (a) the evaluation is flexible, or (b) the evaluators’ descriptions of what was accepted/expected are unreliable/incomplete. In either case, it is not irrefutable that the benchmark is defective.

Alternative explanations: The failing run can be explained by agent error/misinterpretation (wrong keying, missing receiver-in-anonymous check, mutating logs) rather than an unavoidable benchmark defect.

Why I doubt it: this is not irrefutable evidence of a benchmark defect. The benchmark can legitimately define feasibility as membership in a whitelist; that’s a valid (if arbitrary) spec.

Why I doubt it: the hidden code actually contains an explicit, fully-determined formula (`age_score = 1 - (age/100) if age>40 else 1`). A capable agent can elicit this by asking for the exact expression or by asking for example input/output pairs that uniquely identify the function. Two runs are explicitly marked failed=false and report that the user ultimately provided enough details (including the linear/proportional form) to implement correctly. The one evaluation grading 1.0 hinges on a particular interaction where the agent guessed an endpoint (age 60) rather than continuing to pin down the exact formula; that is an agent strategy failure, not proof that the benchmark is impossible or contradictory.

Alternative explanations: (1) the agent asked underspecified questions and accepted an 'acceptable' heuristic rather than insisting on the exact formula; (2) the agent could have requested the precise code line, or asked “is it 1 - age/100?” or asked for outputs at age=50,60,100 to infer the slope.

Evaluation 2 is empty, providing no corroboration.

A capable agent does not need OS/Word/registry-path details at all; it can implement the straightforward conditional logic directly from the prompt/task framing (or infer that the task is to implement diagnose_spell_check with those parameters). The fact that some agents asked irrelevant environment questions and then over-engineered a Windows/COM/registry solution is an agent failure mode, not proof the benchmark is defective.

Alternative explanations: (1) Agents misinterpreted the task as “real-world spellcheck diagnosis” rather than “implement this deterministic diagnostic function.” (2) Agents relied too heavily on dialogue instead of implementing the simplest mapping from inputs to outputs. (3) The user’s occasional ungrounded additions (Word/Windows/registry paths) are a simulated-user quality issue, but not shown to make passing impossible; another run reportedly passed/was not marked as a benchmark failure.

Even if the reference uses string comparison, that is not inherently a benchmark defect if the user-facing spec also implies string comparison (common in simple tasks) or is ambiguous. Ambiguity alone is not an IFE unless it makes correct behavior non-inferable; here, a strong agent could choose the simplest interpretation (string prefix + string >=) and pass. Also, Evaluation 1 reports the run ultimately succeeded (failed=false) and attributes earlier issues to tool misuse, which strongly suggests the benchmark is solvable as-is.

Alternative explanations: (1) The agent in the failing run over-interpreted “version” and implemented numeric parsing when the intended behavior was plain string comparison; that’s an agent choice, not a harness defect. (2) The evaluator may have conflated agent-added assumptions with user requirements. (3) Even if the user asked for numeric parsing, a capable agent could still reconcile by asking clarifying questions or matching examples; we lack proof the conversation forced an incompatible interpretation.

Why I doubt it: This is not irrefutable evidence of a benchmark defect. Many programming benchmarks intentionally omit extra clarifications; the agent is expected to implement a reasonable interpretation from the prompt alone, not to rely on interactive Q&A. The evaluator’s argument hinges on the agent choosing to ask questions and the user refusing—this is compatible with an agent strategy failure (over-reliance on clarification) rather than an intrinsic impossibility.

Alternative explanations: A stronger agent could (a) infer from the prompt that objects are coordinate tuples and axes are coordinate indices, (b) implement a general N-dimensional symmetry check with axes as indices, or (c) implement a robust solution supporting both 2D and ND and multiple axis encodings. The cited hidden code behavior (tuple of coordinates; axis as index) is a common, guessable convention, not an idiosyncratic, unguessable requirement.

The `typing` import restriction is a sandbox constraint with an obvious workaround (use built-in generics like `list[str]`, `tuple[str, int]`), and at least one run reportedly succeeded after adapting. The `finish_answer` vs `final_answer` mismatch could confuse an agent, but it does not make the task unsolvable—an attentive agent can follow the explicitly allowed tools list and call `final_answer`. The code-fence regex requirement is a formatting constraint; failing it is an agent compliance error, not a benchmark contradiction.

The simulated user, despite having the hidden code, responded with uncertainty/vague statements and did not convey these exact constants/conditions to the agent.

Why I accept it: If the public task prompt describes generic inputs like “pan size” and “pan type” without specifying that only pan_size==8 is special-cased, that all non-""round"" types collapse to the same branch, and without providing the exact numeric constants (201.06176, 117, 0.15, 0.1, 325), then the required behavior is not inferable. This is not a matter of agent skill: many plausible implementations (geometric area, different temperature scaling) would be reasonable yet will deterministically fail tests keyed to those magic numbers.

Alternative explanations considered: (1) The agent could have asked for the exact formula/constants—evaluations indicate it did, and the simulated user still did not provide them. (2) The prompt might have explicitly listed these constants—nothing in the evidence suggests that; instead, the mismatch is central to the failure. (3) A stronger agent could guess the constants—guessing exact floating values like 201.06176 and the 325 anchor is not realistically achievable.

Why I doubt it: This is not irrefutable evidence of an IFE.

Why this is not irrefutable IFE: The evidence is inconsistent across runs. Eval 5 indicates the agent could ask about the inconsistency and the user provided a workable clarification (""use question_frequency >= 10 for now""), and the run is marked not failed. That strongly suggests the task is solvable within the interaction constraints and not blocked by the benchmark setup. The ""user refuses to reveal"" narrative (Eval 4) could simply be a particular run’s dialogue/agent prompting failure rather than a benchmark defect that no agent can overcome.

Alternative explanations: A better agent could (and apparently did in another run) elicit sufficient rules/clarifications or implement based on partial rules plus follow-up questions. The >10 vs 1–10 mismatch is a spec inconsistency, but it is not proven to be fatal to evaluation (it can be resolved by clarification or by matching the evaluator’s expected behavior).

Why I doubt it: The provided evidence does not irrefutably show a benchmark defect; it shows a hidden spec/reference implementation exists (common in coding benchmarks) and that the agent did not implement it. The key question for an IFE is whether the agent was supposed to have access to that spec (e.g., via the system/developer prompt or the full task statement) and whether the public task statement is contradictory/impossible. We are not shown the actual task prompt given to the agent, only post-hoc evaluator summaries. Without the full prompt, we cannot conclude the threshold/strings were “not derivable” or undisclosed.

Alternative explanations: (1) The full task statement may have explicitly specified the 600 threshold and exact return strings; the agent simply ignored/missed them. (2) The benchmark may be designed as an information-extraction task where the agent must elicit the needed constraints; the agent instead accepted user permission to invent a catalog and changed the output contract (e.g., returning 'No match found'). (3) Even if the user was unhelpful, a capable agent could implement the simplest deterministic rule-based function consistent with typical hidden specs rather than inventing a catalog.

We are not shown the actual task prompt, the full test harness, or any failing test output demonstrating that alternative category names are accepted by the prompt but rejected by tests. This could easily be an agent-side failure: the task may in fact specify those three categories (or otherwise constrain outputs) and the agent deviated. Also, the presence of a “simulated user instruction block” suggests the benchmark may include additional instructions that the agent was supposed to follow; without seeing them, we cannot conclude the requirements are undisclosed.

Alternative explanations: (1) The prompt explicitly required those keys/rules and the agent ignored them. (2) The benchmark is an interactive-style task but the evaluation fixes the “agreed” categories to a canonical set; a capable agent could infer/adhere to that from the provided conversation.

At least one evaluation explicitly states the simulated user did provide the required mappings and default behavior, and another run succeeded (“failed=false”), showing the task is solvable within the intended protocol.

Why I doubt it: this is not irrefutable evidence of a benchmark defect; it’s consistent with an agent simply not following the (apparently) communicated contract. The user message as quoted actually *does* communicate the key fields and intended behavior: filter by rainy weather, minimum screen_size, and enhanced_brightness boolean. A capable agent could implement exactly that schema and logic (including the boolean equality trick, or more straightforwardly `if rainy: require water_resistance else: require not water_resistance`, which is equivalent). Nothing shown proves the harness rejects reasonable equivalent implementations; it only shows one agent chose a different schema (brand/model/brightness_nits/weather_support) and added extra rules (nits threshold), which is an agent-side divergence.

Alternative explanations: (1) The task likely expects implementing the described filter over the provided dataset/schema; the agent invented a new dataset and semantics, so tests fail. (2) Even if the hidden dataset is fixed, the user could have provided it or the agent could have asked for exact keys/values; failure to do so is not a benchmark impossibility. (3) The alleged “cannot naturally communicate exact behaviors” is unproven—these are simple fields and a simple filter.

It concludes the agent could not infer the hidden logic.

Why I doubt it: This is a single evaluator’s narrative with no primary evidence (no task prompt, no actual hidden tests, no harness logs, no reference code excerpt). The described “non-intuitive” checks are not inherently impossible or contradictory; they could be exactly what the task specification asked for (e.g., a toy scoring function with those constants). The fact that the user simulator gave different units/details does not prove the benchmark is defective; it could simply mean the agent should ignore irrelevant user preferences and implement the specified scoring rules from the prompt.

Alternative explanations: The agent could simply have failed to solve a hard combinatorics/counting problem; the simulated user’s lack of constraints/samples is common and not an IFE.

Why I doubt it: This is not irrefutable evidence of a benchmark defect. Many coding benchmarks intentionally provide a partial stub and expect the agent to implement the function per visible prompt/spec without needing extra “hidden” facts. The fact that the simulated user can’t answer API questions does not prove impossibility; a capable agent could avoid asking for external data sources and simply implement the straightforward behavior implied by the stub (filter destinations by city substring, sort, slice). Also, the evaluators’ key factual premise—""empty destinations list""—may be an artifact of what was shown in the explanation; in real tests, `destinations` could be populated elsewhere (fixture/module constant), making the task perfectly well-defined.

Alternative explanations: The agent likely overcomplicated by choosing Google Places, introducing dependencies/API keys and diverging from the intended simple list-filtering behavior.

Skeptical assessment:
- (B) is not convincing as an intrinsic benchmark defect.

Why I doubt it: Another run’s evaluation (Eval 3) explicitly reports the opposite: the simulated user *did* provide the full required key/value criteria, missing-key behavior, AND semantics, and case sensitivity, and the run succeeded (failed=false). That directly undermines the assertion that the benchmark is intrinsically unable to surface the rule or that “no agent can infer it.”

Alternative explanations: (1) The failing run likely reflects agent-side interaction/formatting/tooling issues or a particular dialogue path where the agent didn’t elicit the info effectively, not a benchmark defect. (2) There may be stochastic variation in the simulated user responses across runs; that would be a reliability concern, but the evidence here is not irrefutable that the benchmark *cannot* be solved—indeed, it apparently was.

Final determination: Because at least one evaluation indicates the hidden requirements were obtainable and the task was completed successfully, there is not overwhelming, irrefutable evidence of an intrinsic formation error. Grade 0."

Why I doubt it: the evidence is not irrefutable. We only have an evaluator’s assertion of the hidden reference mapping; no actual task prompt, official reference, or failing test logs are shown. It’s entirely plausible the original prompt *did* specify the exact mapping (e.g., “return the starter Pokémon for each region” or provided the exact lists) and the agent simply deviated (used 5 Pokémon, different choices, and lowercased keys). Also, even if the prompt said “hard-coded,” that can imply a specific provided mapping in the full statement; we don’t see it here.

Alternative explanations: (1) Agent error: wrong mapping content and wrong key normalization/case handling relative to spec. (2) Spec could have required exact region capitalization and exact lists. (3) Tests might accept any list but the agent failed other requirements (format, ordering, etc.).

Why I doubt it: The provided evidence is not the actual benchmark spec or harness output—it's an evaluator’s narrative about a “hidden expected logic.” Without the original task statement and the real unit tests, this could simply be the evaluator over-interpreting one possible reference implementation. Many benchmarks do specify exact rules/thresholds in the prompt; the evaluator’s claim that the prompt only says “take into account” is unverified here. Also, even if the prompt is somewhat underspecified, that does not automatically prove the tests require one arbitrary mapping; tests could accept multiple outputs or check for inclusion of factors rather than exact constants.

Alternative explanations: (1) The agent may have failed to follow explicit instructions (e.g., required exact decision boundaries or specific model list) that were in the prompt but not shown here. (2) The benchmark may have had a clearly defined rubric (e.g., exact scoring) and the agent implemented a different heuristic. (3) The binary “Correct: 0” across runs could be ordinary agent failure.

This is not a case of a hard problem; it’s underdetermined. Multiple distinct implementations would be equally reasonable, yet only one hidden mapping is accepted.

Alternative explanations considered: Could a better agent infer the exact threshold (60), the exact string tokens, and the branch priority? Not from the described interaction—especially since the simulated user explicitly could not provide the missing specs. Without those details, any agent would be guessing, and the probability of matching the exact hidden lists/ordering is negligible.

Why I doubt it: This is not irrefutable evidence of a benchmark defect.

That makes failure plausibly agent-caused rather than impossible.

Alternative explanations: The agent may have overfit to conversationally-agreed defaults that diverge from tests; or tests may actually align with the user-approved behavior (we are not shown failing test outputs). Also, the alleged contradiction (punctuation handling, tie-breaking) is not proven to be required by the written task statement; it’s an implementation detail that agents can choose conservatively.

Why I doubt it: None of this is irrefutable evidence that *no* agent could succeed. Tool-name mismatches are common in model writeups but typically non-fatal: agents can still submit via the actual available tool (`final_answer`). The regex complaint (“```...``` was not found”) indicates the agent likely failed to include the required fenced code block in the final submission—an agent formatting error, not necessarily a benchmark defect. The “do not execute code” vs observed execution is also not a contradiction that makes the task impossible; many coding benchmarks execute submissions for testing while instructing the agent not to run code itself. That’s a normal separation (agent shouldn’t run; harness will).

Alternative explanations: The agent could have complied by outputting the solution inside a proper triple-backticked python code block and then using the correct finalization tool. A more careful agent could likely pass.
