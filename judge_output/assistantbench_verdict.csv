Why I doubt/accept IFE: The traces described show the environment working (Google accessible; third-party catalogs like FlickMetrix accessible) and relevant information (Netflix availability lists + IMDb ratings) obtainable. No evidence is presented of a harness bug, impossible/contradictory requirements, blocked access (CAPTCHA/login), or an evaluation mismatch that would reject a valid answer.

Alternative explanations: The agents simply stopped early and did not (a) enumerate all candidate Daniel Craig titles on Netflix US, (b) check runtimes (<150 minutes), and (c) select the max IMDb rating among qualifiers. A sufficiently capable agent could use FlickMetrix/JustWatch/uNoGS plus IMDb runtime to complete the task.

Final determination: With no irrefutable benchmark defect shown—and clear plausible agent-side failure modes—this does not meet the threshold for an Intrinsic Formation Error."

Why I doubt/accept IFE: The traces show agents either stopping immediately or only performing a Google search/click without extracting daily precipitation data or computing the requested percentage. That is classic agent non-completion, not a harness/prompt impossibility. The prompt itself is coherent (location, date range, years, precipitation threshold, percent output).

Alternative explanations considered: (1) Ambiguity about “first week of September” (Sep 1–7 vs first full week) could exist, but it’s not shown to be irreconcilable or to cause systematic rejection; a capable agent could state an assumption and compute accordingly. (2) Potential paywalls/CAPTCHAs/data access issues are not evidenced; evaluators explicitly note Google results load and plausible sources exist.

Why this is not irrefutable: Three other runs show Google Maps search pages loading and returning karting/paintball results, which directly contradicts the notion that the environment universally blocks access to the key resource. Even in Evaluation 2’s own text, it notes the agent “later accessed some Google Maps pages directly,” suggesting a workaround existed and the block was not absolute.

Alternative explanations: (1) The reCAPTCHA could be transient, route-specific (Search→Maps redirect), IP-rate/behavior triggered, or solvable by using direct maps URLs, alternative mapping sources, or different navigation patterns. (2) DuckDuckGo 418 could be temporary and non-essential given Google Maps availability.

Bottom line: Evidence does not show a benchmark defect that NO capable agent could overcome; it shows at most intermittent bot-detection affecting one run. With reasonable doubt and successful partial access in other runs, this is not an intrinsic formation error."

Even in the blocked run, the evaluator notes accessible non-Maps results were available. A CAPTCHA on one site at one time is not a benchmark-intrinsic defect unless it makes the task impossible across reasonable alternative sources, which is not demonstrated here.

Alternative explanations: Agents largely failed to do the required work—verifying (a) walking time from NYSE and (b) actual class times in the 7–9 pm window—often stopping at SERP snippets or extracting generic hours rather than schedules. A stronger agent could use accessible listings and/or official school sites to confirm locations and evening class schedules, and could avoid blocked services by switching sources.

Why this is not irrefutable IFE evidence: (1) Only one of four runs reports this, while other runs successfully used Google and another site (NYU News) to extract relevant information; this strongly suggests the environment is generally functional. (2) Even if Yelp is blocked/empty, the task is not inherently dependent on Yelp—agents can verify distance and menu prices via Google Maps panels, restaurant official sites, other directories, or alternative articles. A single inaccessible source/path is not a benchmark defect unless the task requires that specific site or all reasonable sources are inaccessible. (3) “Empty page” could be transient (network hiccup, timing, consent/interstitial not captured, scrolling/viewport issue), not a definitive benchmark-wide impossibility.

Alternative explanations: agent could have avoided Yelp, retried, used cached/other sources, or validated constraints with multiple sites. The other evaluations indicate failures were due to incomplete verification/filtering rather than inability to access information.

(2) Another run reached relevant NCBI RefSeq annotation pages and the NCBI FTP directory, indicating dependencies and websites are reachable; the failure was a transient click/navigation tool error, which is not an intrinsic benchmark defect. (3) Two runs did essentially nothing (stuck at about:blank), which provides no evidence about benchmark correctness.

Alternative explanations: The task may expect a specific “May 2020 relevant files” link (e.g., an NCBI annotation release directory or a particular assembly/annotation file set) and agents either chose the wrong source (UCSC assembly directory vs. NCBI annotation release) or failed to finalize the answer. A stronger agent could resolve the “most relevant in May 2020” phrasing by triangulating release dates and selecting the correct directory/file link.

Why I doubt this is an intrinsic benchmark defect: shipping a “DVD” strongly implies a small, light parcel/letter with fairly standard assumptions (single DVD in a mailer; default consumer/retail rates; cheapest available service). Many real-world quote tools (notably USPS international calculators) can return usable prices with minimal inputs (origin ZIP + destination country + package type/weight), and the other evaluations show the agent could reach USPS’s calculator page. That indicates the task is at least solvable under a reasonable default interpretation rather than provably impossible.

Alternative explanations: the agents largely failed to (a) complete the USPS calculator inputs, (b) check FedEx/DHL at all, and (c) output the required JSON schema. Those are straightforward agent/tool-use failures. A more capable agent could pick standard assumptions (e.g., 1 DVD ~ 3–8 oz in a small package) and obtain quotes; even if multiple answers are possible, that’s not irrefutable evidence the benchmark cannot have a consistent reference answer.

At least one run (Evaluation 3) explicitly shows Google Maps accessible and gym sites reachable, including a Liftonic schedule page displaying a 6:30am class (i.e., key required information was obtainable). That directly undermines the claim of an intrinsic, unavoidable benchmark/environment defect that “no agent could overcome.” This looks like run-to-run variability in bot-detection rather than a deterministic, intrinsic formation error.

Alternative explanations: (1) Agent strategy/execution failures: not using accessible Maps in runs where it worked; not navigating to schedules/classes pages; not compiling results. (2) Workarounds exist even if Maps is blocked in some runs: use other map providers (OpenStreetMap), geocode addresses and compute distances, use business listings, or use gym schedule platforms (Mindbody/ClassPass) once gyms are identified. (3) reCAPTCHA is a common transient obstacle; it does not prove the benchmark is structurally impossible.

Multiple evaluations explicitly note accessible snippets with follower counts (e.g., LinkedIn vs X vs Facebook).

Evaluation 1 shows Zillow blocking automation but explicitly notes alternative sources (e.g., Redfin) exist and the agent simply stopped early. Thus, the supposed “no viable access path” is not stable or universal.

Alternative explanations: (a) The agent in Eval 4 used a stale/incorrect Redfin neighborhood ID/path (852) or Redfin changed URL structure; a better agent could navigate via Redfin’s search UI, use different neighborhood pages, or use other public sources (county records, other real-estate aggregators). (b) Google reCAPTCHA can be sporadic/session-based; other runs indicate it’s not a guaranteed barrier. (c) Even if one specific Redfin URL 404s, the task does not require that canonical URL—only the answer.

(2) Why I doubt it: This is not irrefutable evidence of an intrinsic benchmark defect. A single run hitting Google reCAPTCHA does not prove the environment is systematically blocked (other runs clearly accessed Google and/or the park pages). Likewise, “official page currently shows 2025” does not prove 2024 pricing is impossible to obtain within the benchmark—an agent could use alternate sources (archived pages like the Wayback Machine, cached pages, press releases, other ticketing pages with date parameters, or third-party listings) or infer pricing for the relevant 2024 dates if the task allows reasonable sourcing. The evidence provided does not demonstrate that *all* reasonable retrieval paths are blocked.

(3) Alternative explanations: The agents may have stopped early, failed to search for “2024” specifically, failed to use archives, or failed to compute savings even with available “from $42” / pass price snippets. Also, ambiguity about which ticket/pass tier to use is not an IFE; a competent agent can choose and justify a specific product.

Minor underspecification about data source/aggregation does not make the task impossible, nor is there evidence the grader would reject reasonable choices.

Eval 2 shows Google Maps hit a reCAPTCHA in that run, but the agent still found alternate sources (GymBird) and the evaluator explicitly notes the task remained solvable via other map providers / routing sources; the failure was filtering/verification mistakes.

A single run encountering reCAPTCHA or transient load errors is consistent with stochastic network/anti-bot variability or that agent’s chosen approach (using Google, trying a guessed URL that 404s), not a provable, universal benchmark impossibility.

Alternative explanations considered: (1) Agent could bypass Google entirely by directly visiting known museum URLs (as other runs did).

A CAPTCHA appearing in one run is consistent with transient/route-specific bot detection, not a provable, task-level impossibility.

Alternative explanations: (1) The agent in the CAPTCHA run triggered bot detection due to navigation pattern, region/IP, or repeated automated requests; another agent/run avoided it. (2) Even if Maps is blocked sometimes, the task is still solvable via non-Maps sources (accessible bar listings + address proximity via other map providers), so it’s not clearly impossible.

No evaluation provides concrete evidence that valid solutions would be systematically rejected or that required data was truly inaccessible.

(2) Why I accept it: This is concrete, repeated, site-level bot protection blocking both the homepage, search/filter pages, and individual listing pages. The evidence is specific (URLs, page titles, and the challenge text) and consistent across 4 runs. A “press and hold” human-verification gate is not something an automated agent can reliably solve in this constrained benchmark browser, and the 403 via alternate retrieval indicates it’s not merely a UI automation glitch.

(3) Alternatives considered: Could an agent use other sources (Google snippets, other real estate sites) to answer? The task explicitly ties the ground truth to Zillow and requires an exhaustive minimum across a province and date range—something not feasibly reconstructible from snippets or third-party listings without Zillow access. Could an agent bypass via Wayback or mirrors? One run checked Wayback and found no relevant captures; the proxy attempt got 403. These are plausible workarounds and they appear unavailable.

(4) Final determination: Overwhelming evidence of an environment/target-site accessibility defect (Zillow anti-bot/CAPTCHA) that prevents completing the task as specified. This is a genuine Intrinsic Formation Error."

A Google block is therefore an agent path/tool-choice issue, not an intrinsic impossibility in the benchmark.

Alternative explanations considered: (1) A capable agent can bypass Google entirely by navigating Ensembl/NCBI FTP/archives directly; evidence shows this was feasible. (2) The failures described in Evals 1–3 are classic incompletion/selection errors (returning a directory instead of a file; not choosing the correct release/file by date), not harness rejection or missing data. (3) Even if Google is intermittently blocked, that does not make the benchmark itself defective when the required information is otherwise accessible.

(2) Why I doubt it: Eval 1 does not prove impossibility; it only shows that one specific NWS page is insufficient. That’s an agent/path failure, not a benchmark defect—daily snowfall/precip occurrence data for Chicago can plausibly be obtained from multiple other sources (e.g., NOAA Local Climatological Data, station daily summaries, third-party weather history sites), and the task doesn’t require a single mandated source. Eval 4 shows transient, run-specific access problems (Google CAPTCHA, NCEI outage), but those are not irrefutable, benchmark-intrinsic defects: they may be intermittent, avoidable (use alternate search engines/direct URLs/other datasets), or specific to that run’s traffic patterns.

(3) Alternative explanations considered: A stronger agent could bypass Google (Bing/DDG/Wikipedia/NOAA direct endpoints), use alternate climatology archives, or use non-NCEI weather-history providers to compile Dec 31 2014–2023 snow occurrence. Also, the ‘definition of snow’ ambiguity is not proven to be unresolvable; reasonable interpretations (measurable snowfall >0, or observed snow) exist and could be consistently applied.

Why this is not irrefutable: The evidence is limited to the UI reporting ""empty page"" after loading TripAdvisor URLs. That does not conclusively prove the benchmark environment cannot access TripAdvisor; it could be a transient load failure, a blocked resource that might be bypassed (e.g., using m.tripadvisor.com/amp pages, adding ?m=1, switching to a different locale/domain, using textise dot iitty? no), a consent/cookie modal not captured as an interactive element, or simply the agent not waiting/retrying/changing approach. Only one run documents a CAPTCHA, and it is for Google cache—not the primary target—so it does not prove impossibility.

Alternative explanations: (1) Agent execution failure: not attempting common mitigations (wait, reload, open in new tab, try another TripAdvisor page format, use a different source allowed by the task if TripAdvisor is inaccessible). (2) Task feasibility: even if TripAdvisor is flaky, a capable agent might still succeed by finding TripAdvisor content via alternate accessible endpoints or by using multiple TripAdvisor pages that do render. The evaluations do not show that *all* TripAdvisor access paths are systematically blocked for the environment.

One run is marked correct/failed:false, directly demonstrating solvability. That alone strongly undermines any claim of an intrinsic benchmark defect.

Alternative explanations: The failures are consistent with agent-side issues—navigating to the wrong page (membership instead of admission), not scrolling/extracting fully, tool/index click errors, and not performing or outputting the final arithmetic.

Two of the four evaluations explicitly note alternative sources (Compass, Redfin, Realtor.com, Business Journals, other reports) that were not demonstrated to be blocked, and the failing agents did not exhaust them.

Why I doubt an IFE: The strongest alleged IFE (conflicting prompts) is only asserted by one evaluator and is not corroborated by the other runs’ descriptions, which consistently treat the task as the Yellowstone hikes research problem. Without the actual trace showing both prompts in the same evaluated turn, this could be a logging artifact, a separate system message, or evaluator confusion—not irrefutable contradiction.

The TripAdvisor-accessibility claim also isn’t decisive: another evaluation explicitly shows TripAdvisor data (ratings/review counts) visible via Google snippets and indicates individual TripAdvisor pages were reachable, while only some TripAdvisor pages (e.g., an attractions listing or a forum thread) rendered empty. That suggests partial blocking/renderer issues on some URLs, but not a definitive “no agent could complete the task.” A capable agent could work around by using accessible TripAdvisor attraction pages reached from Google results, alternative TripAdvisor endpoints, cached text in SERP snippets, or other sources for the “parents/kids” recommendations.

Alternative explanations: agent incompletion and failure to verify constraints (>=4.5 and >=50 reviews; three distinct parent recommenders) explains the 0.0 grades in Evaluations 1–2. Partial site rendering issues are common but not inherently fatal when other pages/snippets remain accessible.

Alternative explanations considered: The task may be time-consuming (needing to check join-time titles via bios/press releases/filings), but that is not an IFE—just workload/agent persistence. Agents stopping early, taking no actions, or failing to synthesize “C-suite at the time they joined” is plainly agent failure.

Why this is not irrefutable: The evidence is inconsistent across runs and not clearly intrinsic to the benchmark. Two evaluations (1 and 2) attribute failure primarily to agent navigation/click-handling and lack of robust retries, noting no demonstrated universal unreachability (no persistent 404/paywall shown). The “chrome-error://chromewebdata/” symptom can be caused by transient automation errors (bad click timing, navigation race, tab/context destruction) rather than a hard network/TLS block affecting all agents. The reCAPTCHA also appears in only one run; that’s not proof the task is impossible—agents can often work around by using direct URLs, alternative sources, or non-Google discovery.

Alternative explanations considered: (a) agent-induced navigation context errors leading to chrome-error; (b) temporary connectivity hiccups; (c) bot-detection only triggered by certain interaction patterns. A sufficiently capable agent could plausibly succeed by directly navigating to fundresearch pages, using different query sources, or extracting the required performance data via other accessible finance data providers.

There is no indication of CAPTCHA blocks, login walls, dead sites, missing tools, or a scoring harness that rejects valid outputs. The requirement—identify Ted Danson series with >1 season, confirm Amazon Prime Video US availability, then choose the lowest Rotten Tomatoes rating—is demanding but not contradictory or provably impossible.

Alternative explanations considered: The agents appear to have stopped early, pursued irrelevant sources (Ranker/Next-Episode), or never clicked into Rotten Tomatoes/availability sources. A sufficiently capable agent could enumerate Ted Danson TV credits, filter by season count, check RT scores, and verify Prime availability via RT “Where to Watch,” PrimeVideo, or JustWatch.

The “underspecified price source” argument is also not irrefutable: many benchmarks expect agents to pick a reasonable authoritative source (e.g., MTGGoldfish/TCGplayer) and proceed. Lack of explicit source does not prove the harness would reject valid answers, nor that no single intended interpretation exists. Also, one run is marked correct despite this alleged ambiguity.

Dynamic pricing similarly does not prove impossibility: the question asks which supermarkets “have” salads under $15, which can be answered using publicly accessible menu/delivery aggregators (Instacart, DoorDash, Uber Eats), store circulars, or prepared-foods pages; it need not rely on Whole Foods’ gated pricing. The Google Maps CAPTCHA is a workaround-able access issue (use other map providers or search results) and only affected one attempt.

Alternative explanations: The failures shown are consistent with agent strategy/execution problems (stopping early, not measuring distance, not verifying salad prices, tool/tab errors), not a benchmark/harness defect that would reject valid solutions.

(2) Why I doubt it: Two independent evaluations (2 and 3) point out a credible workaround using an accessible source the agents already reached: monday.com Investor Relations “Management Team” bios, which include “has served as [C-suite role] since YEAR” for current executives. If you know the IPO date (June 2021), you can determine which current C-suite members started after 2021 and therefore were not in those roles at IPO—without SEC.gov or Google. That means the task is not provably impossible in the benchmark environment.

(3) Alternative explanations: The failures can be explained by agent strategy (over-reliance on SEC filings) and by choosing a stale leadership URL (404) instead of the working IR management-team page. A sufficiently capable agent could (a) use the IR page to list current C-suite and start dates, and (b) compare to June 2021 to answer the question. Even if SEC is blocked, the needed inference is still available.

Why this is not irrefutable IFE evidence: The strongest IFE claim is the access blocking, but it is not consistent across runs. Other evaluations show DHL/FedEx pages did load and the agent could proceed partway (e.g., navigating to mydhl.express and FedEx rating). That strongly suggests the environment is not deterministically blocking all agents. A transient reCAPTCHA or occasional chrome-error does not prove “no agent could succeed”; a capable agent could use alternate sources (Bing/DuckDuckGo), go directly to carrier rate tools, retry, use different endpoints/regions, or use USPS/FedEx/DHL pages without Google.

On underspecification: While the prompt lacks weight/dimensions and precise definition of “1-week delivery,” this is not a provable impossibility or contradiction. A reasonable interpretation (standard document envelope, minimal weight, closest-to-1-week economy/expedited service, retail rate) would yield a defensible answer. Benchmark tasks often tolerate such assumptions; the evidence does not show the grader would reject reasonable assumptions.

Alternative explanation (more likely): The failures are primarily agent-side (wrong direction for USPS, not completing rate forms, stopping before extracting final prices) plus occasional transient connectivity/bot-detection, not an intrinsic benchmark defect.

Final determination: There is not overwhelming, consistent, irrefutable evidence that the benchmark/evaluation setup makes the task impossible for any agent. Grade 0."
