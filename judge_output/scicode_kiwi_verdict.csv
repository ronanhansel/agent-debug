Why I doubt these constitute irrefutable IFEs:
- The <code>...</code> parsing claim is plausible but not proven as an intrinsic benchmark defect. Many CodeRunner-style harnesses accept multiple formats or provide explicit wrapping instructions; the evaluator’s message suggests how to format, so a capable agent could comply by outputting the required <code> block even if the prompt also mentions backticks. This is a format-following failure, not a provably impossible requirement.
- The simps issue is not clearly intrinsic: the benchmark’s stated allowed import is actually “from scipy.integrate import simpson as simps”, which works on modern SciPy. The reported failure arises when the agent (or scaffold) tries “from scipy.integrate import simps”. That could be the agent’s mistake, not the harness’s. There’s no concrete evidence that the official hidden tests import simps incorrectly.
- The j0 “missing dependency” is speculative. SciPy normally includes scipy.special; the fact it isn’t listed in a dependency hint doesn’t prove it’s unavailable in the environment. Also, a capable agent could avoid j0 entirely (e.g., implement a basic Bessel approximation or use alternative numeric approaches) if needed. No trace shows an actual NameError/ImportError for j0 during evaluation.

Alternative explanation: the agents simply failed to follow the required output format and/or used incorrect imports; a better agent could succeed.

Final determination: evidence is not overwhelming or irrefutable that the benchmark is intrinsically broken; reasonable agent-side failure explanations remain. Hence grade 0."

Why this is not irrefutable IFE evidence: Two independent runs (Evaluations 3 and 4) are marked successful on this same task, demonstrating the task is solvable within the benchmark constraints and that the evaluation setup does not universally reject valid solutions. That alone defeats any claim that “no agent could overcome” the setup.

Alternative explanations: The parse errors and failures in Evaluations 1 and 2 plausibly stem from those agents’ own formatting/prose output and/or incorrect final code (wrong function, returning list instead of numpy array, monkeypatching numpy), not a defective benchmark. Even if a particular interface sometimes expects <code> tags, the existence of successful runs suggests there is a workable submission format path.

Import restriction (heapq) and statelessness are friction/constraint issues, not contradictions or impossibilities; agents can use allowed queue.PriorityQueue or brute force, and can test within single calls.

Final determination: There is not overwhelming, irrefutable evidence of an intrinsic benchmark defect; observed failures are reasonably attributable to agent mistakes and/or avoidable format mismatches."

Why this is not irrefutable IFE evidence: None of the provided material includes the actual task statement, the official required output format, or the harness specification—only evaluators’ interpretations plus snippets of error messages. Even if the MatMult NotImplementedError occurred, that does not prove the benchmark is defective: a capable agent can trivially avoid '@' by using np.dot / explicit multiplication, so this is at most an environment constraint, not an impossible or contradictory requirement. Likewise, the '<code>(.*?)</code>' parsing claim could be an artifact of the particular agent wrapper (e.g., returning via final_answer(""""""..."""""") or malformed markdown) rather than the benchmark itself; without seeing the canonical submission format for SciCode, it’s plausible the agent simply didn’t follow the actual required formatting. The “forbidden function evaluation” and “invalid character …” errors also look like tool-usage/interaction mistakes rather than a benchmark-intrinsic impossibility.

Alternative explanations: The agent could (1) implement ABCD multiplication without '@' and (2) output in whatever exact format the platform expects (many code-eval systems require a single plain code snippet, not markdown). These are solvable by a sufficiently careful agent; nothing here proves that *no* agent could succeed.

Final determination: Evidence shows tooling/formatting friction in these runs, but not overwhelming, benchmark-level impossibility or a provable spec–harness contradiction. Therefore, grade 0."

Why this is not irrefutable: The evidence provided is second-hand summaries, not the actual task prompt + official evaluator contract. It’s entirely plausible the real benchmark instructions (or the interactive tool wrapper) explicitly require <code>...</code> blocks, and the agents simply followed the wrong formatting (or produced malformed snippets like a stray “</code>”). A parser expecting <code>...</code> is not inherently defective if that is the platform’s true required interface. Likewise, the “single function/no imports” constraint is common in coding benchmarks; a capable agent can avoid global imports by importing inside the function or rewriting to avoid external dependencies (or using standard-library-only approaches if allowed). Without concrete proof that imports are required/allowed by the benchmark but then removed by evaluation in a way no solution can satisfy, this remains speculative.

Alternative explanations: (1) Agent formatting errors triggered the regex failure (missing opening <code>, outputting plain text, mixing markdown fences with tool-required tags). (2) Agent failed to adapt code to the expected single-function environment (e.g., using local imports). (3) The evaluator might provide np/scipy in the execution globals despite stripping imports, making the NameError concern unfounded.

Final determination: There is not overwhelming, irrefutable evidence that the benchmark is impossible or self-contradictory for all agents. The failures described can reasonably be attributed to agent noncompliance with an interface contract or insufficient adaptation to common evaluation constraints. Therefore, no IFE is proven."

Why I doubt it: The evidence is secondhand summaries, not the actual task statement + raw grader logs. A parser expecting <code>...</code> is not inherently a benchmark defect if the platform’s submission protocol is to wrap the final answer that way (many tool-using setups do). Likewise, “do not include imports” is common when the harness preloads numpy/scipy; missing imports would then be the agent’s fault only if the agent violated the protocol (or referenced names not provided). The alleged mid-run “system instruction” conflicts could also just be the normal scaffold: earlier steps may ask for a full program in explanation, while the actual graded artifact is a single function.

Alternative explanations: (1) The agent failed to follow the required submission format (wrapping in <code>final_answer(...)</code>), so the regex error is agent failure, not an IFE. (2) np/si may be injected by the harness; if so, there is no environment defect—agent just didn’t comply with the expected interface/naming. (3) Naming mismatches (press_from_rho vs eos_press_from_rho) could be resolved by aliases inside the function; not proven impossible.

Bottom line: There isn’t irrefutable proof that a correct, protocol-following agent could not pass. The shown failures can reasonably be attributed to agent formatting/interface noncompliance rather than an intrinsic benchmark defect."

Why I doubt this is an intrinsic benchmark defect: The strongest-seeming claim is (A), but the evidence presented is indirect and could simply reflect starter/scaffold code that is intentionally incomplete and meant to be replaced by the agent. A placeholder helper function is not automatically an IFE unless the task *requires* using it unchanged or the evaluation forbids replacing it. The evaluator’s own alternative (agent “deviate from provided code/spec and implement a different matrix scheme”) is exactly what competent agents do on many benchmarks: ignore broken scaffolding and implement the required functionality directly. The reported TypeError (“unary - on list”) is fully consistent with an agent naively using obviously-placeholder code rather than a proof that no correct solution can be produced.

For (B), the `<code>(.*?)</code>` parsing errors and “stateless python_interpreter” claims sound like interaction/protocol issues, but the snippets shown (e.g., the harness trying to parse `0.83</code>` or explanatory text) strongly suggest the agent output was malformed at that step. That is not irrefutable evidence the harness rejects valid solutions; it could simply be that the agent failed to output code in the expected format for that platform. Also, these are benchmark-suite/platform-level formatting conventions, not necessarily a defect in *this task*, and there’s no proof that a careful agent consistently outputting the expected code block would be rejected.

Alternative explanation: A capable agent could implement the matrix construction and FD scheme correctly (ignoring/overriding placeholder helpers), and could comply with the platform’s required output format once known. Nothing here proves the requirements are impossible or that valid code is definitively rejected.

Final determination: The evidence does not meet the “overwhelming, irrefutable” standard for an intrinsic formation error in the benchmark itself. Grade 0."

(2) Why I doubt these are true IFEs: The <code>(.*?)</code> “regex not found” message is consistent with an agent simply not following the platform’s required submission wrapper (e.g., failing to put the answer inside the expected final_answer/code container). That’s a formatting/compliance failure by the agent, not proof the benchmark is contradictory or impossible—many agents succeed on such platforms by obeying the required wrapper even if they also use markdown in analysis. Also, the evidence presented is second-hand summaries; we are not shown the actual task statement establishing an irreconcilable requirement for markdown fences over <code> tags.

For numpy.random: even if numpy.random is blocked in the sandbox, the task is still solvable by using Python’s built-in random (or deterministic/stubbed RNG if allowed) to generate uniform/normal variates. The evaluation itself typically checks output deterministically; nothing here proves the benchmark demands numpy.random specifically or that randomness is unworkaroundable. This looks like an environment constraint an agent can adapt to, not an intrinsic formation error that “no agent could overcome.”

(3) Alternative explanations: Agent produced prose instead of code in the final channel; agent didn’t adhere to the required extraction format; agent attempted to test code in a restricted interpreter and misattributed sandbox limits to benchmark defects.

(4) Final determination: There is not overwhelming, irrefutable evidence of a benchmark defect that would prevent a capable agent from completing/passing. The failures plausibly stem from agent formatting/tool-usage choices and adaptible sandbox restrictions. Grade=0."

Why this is not irrefutable IFE evidence: None of the evidence shows the *official* task requires using '@', numpy.random, or any particular wrapper, nor that hidden tests would necessarily invoke these. A capable agent can implement all required linear algebra with np.dot / np.matmul (or explicit einsum) and avoid numpy.random entirely. So (a) and (c) are environmental limitations but not proven to make the task unsatisfiable or to “definitively reject valid solutions.”

The <code>...</code> parsing claim is also not proven intrinsic to Task 71 specifically: the cited parsing errors appear to come from how those agents formatted intermediate outputs in the interactive trace, but we are not shown the actual submission interface requirements or that a correctly formatted final answer (e.g., a single python code block) would be rejected. The evidence is consistent with agent-side formatting/interaction mistakes (e.g., emitting stray text like “0.9</code>”, mixing prose and code, or not following the platform’s expected tool protocol), rather than a guaranteed benchmark contradiction.

Alternative explanation: the agents failed due to their own handling of the environment constraints (using '@' despite prior errors; adding placeholders; not producing a clean final code artifact). Another agent could succeed by (1) never using '@', (2) avoiding forbidden modules, and (3) adhering to the platform’s expected code-only output format.

Final determination: There is not overwhelming, task-specific proof that the benchmark is defective in a way no agent could overcome. Environmental quirks exist, but they look like known sandbox constraints with straightforward workarounds, and the wrapper issue is not conclusively demonstrated as an unavoidable evaluator bug.

Why I’m not convinced this is an IFE: The evidence is second-hand summaries, not the actual task prompt, grader specification, or full trace showing what the agent sent vs what the parser expected. The reported regex error can easily be an agent-formatting mistake (e.g., returning prose, nesting code incorrectly, or using final_answer wrong) rather than a provably contradictory benchmark requirement. Many such harnesses accept markdown code blocks; a parser complaining about a missing pattern may just mean the agent included stray text or failed to include a code block at the final step.

On the SciPy point, even if simps is missing, that is typically workaroundable by using scipy.integrate.simpson or providing a small compatibility alias (try/except) inside the submission—so it’s not “NO agent could overcome.” Also, the evaluations themselves note a shim was claimed; without the real code context, it’s not irrefutable that the benchmark requires simps specifically or that using simpson would be rejected.

Alternative explanations: A stronger agent could (1) strictly follow the harness’s demonstrated instruction about final_answer formatting if present in the interaction, (2) ensure the output is a single clean code snippet, and (3) add a simps/simpson compatibility layer. These are typical agent-correctable failures.

Final determination: The provided summaries do not rise to overwhelming, irrefutable proof of an intrinsic benchmark defect that no capable agent could navigate. Grade 0."
