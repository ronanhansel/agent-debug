Why I doubt/accept it: There is no concrete evidence of a benchmark/evaluation defect (no contradictory requirements, no impossible constraints, no harness rejecting valid outputs, no missing dependencies). The evaluator even notes that if a failure occurred, it would more likely be due to some external setup mismatch, but provides no proof of such a mismatch.

Alternative explanations: If the submission was marked wrong, it could be due to agent-side issues not shown here (e.g., wrong function name/signature, wrong entity string casing/spacing, not matching exact expected I/O format). These are common and do not imply an intrinsic benchmark defect.

Why I doubt an IFE: The evaluations themselves are inconsistent about requirements (one says missing keys treated as 0; another says mismatched categories are an error and wants a breakdown). That inconsistency suggests the *agents* may have diverged in interpretation or the evaluator summaries are imperfect—not that the benchmark is impossible. There is no irrefutable sign of a harness bug (e.g., rejecting correct outputs) or contradictory requirements that no solution could satisfy.

Alternative explanations: Hidden tests likely expect one specific policy (e.g., union-with-0 vs strict key match; no rounding). Agents that rounded, coerced types, returned extra structure, or raised errors when not expected would fail. A sufficiently careful agent could ask/adhere to the dialogue’s clarified policy and implement accordingly.

In Evals 2 and 3, the evaluators themselves note the task is fully specified and solvable; no concrete evidence is presented of an evaluator rejecting a valid solution (e.g., a shown correct implementation failing due to harness bugs).

Alternative explanations: (a) Agent formatting/output-channel issues, (b) subtle agent-side mismatches (validation, edge cases, rounding), or (c) the evaluator’s “incorrect” label being due to something not shown (e.g., missing final code block).

The only hint is that the run was marked incorrect despite a seemingly correct one-liner, but that is not proof of a benchmark defect—could be missing required wrapper/function name, formatting/extraction mismatch, or the agent not matching the exact expected interface in the hidden tests.

Alternative explanations: (1) The benchmark expects a specific function signature/name and the agent didn’t provide it. (2) The evaluation harness extracts code in a particular way and the agent’s response format didn’t match.

Here, the core requirement (sum durations in seconds, convert to minutes, round to nearest minute; empty -> 0) is straightforward and solvable. The other evaluations explicitly note the task is sufficiently specified or that a robust/assumption-based solution could pass.

Why I doubt this is an IFE: lack of rounding instruction is not a contradiction or impossibility; a competent agent can choose the most test-robust interpretation (return full-precision float / no rounding) or ask and then default conservatively. Alternative explanation: the agent introduced rounding to 2 decimals, which can easily cause exact-match test failures if the harness expects the direct formula output.

Why I accept it: If the benchmark uses hidden unit tests with fixed numeric cutoffs/labels, then the task is intrinsically under-specified: many different threshold schemes are consistent with the conversation, and there is no way to infer the benchmark’s specific constants from the provided information. This is not merely “hard” or “needs domain knowledge”—there is no single authoritative mapping because Saab horsepower varies by year/trim, and the dialogue explicitly authorizes the agent to choose ranges. A strict grader expecting one particular set of cutoffs would therefore be rejecting other equally valid solutions.

Alternative explanations considered: (1) The benchmark might instead accept any reasonable scheme (property-based tests) — but all three runs report failure despite implementing user-agreed ranges, which is consistent with fixed hidden expectations. (2) The agent could have looked up real ranges — but even then there is no unique ground truth mapping to labels like “Linear/Aero/Turbo X” across models/years, so tests would still be arbitrary unless the prompt specified a particular dataset/definition.

The only discrepancy described is that some agents added extra behavior (clamping, special-casing) that may not match the hidden tests.

Why I doubt it: The evidence provided is only that a simulated user says the hidden info “does not specify” the formula and that the agent had to guess. That is not irrefutable proof the benchmark is defective. Many benchmarks intentionally leave a simple, conventional mapping implicit (e.g., total minerals == depth, or depth * fixed constant stated elsewhere in the original prompt not shown here), or they may simply require implementing a straightforward arithmetic relation given in the actual task statement (which we do not see). The evaluator is inferring impossibility from the dialogue, but the dialogue itself could be incomplete, mis-specified, or the agent could have failed to read/retain the actual requirement.

Alternative explanations: (1) The original prompt (outside the quoted dialogue) may have specified the mapping; the agent missed it. (2) Hidden tests may accept multiple reasonable behaviors (e.g., any linear mapping with a parameter), or the function signature may include total minerals directly, making the “missing formula” moot.

Why I doubt it: Cross-domain “contamination” in the natural-language prompt is not, by itself, irrefutable evidence of a benchmark/evaluation defect. Many benchmarks contain irrelevant or noisy text; competent agents can (and often should) ignore unrelated UI copy and implement the explicitly testable artifact (here, the Python function with a given signature). The evaluations provide no concrete evidence that the hidden tests actually require HTML/CSS output or that the harness rejects correct Python solutions because of the extra text.

Alternative explanations: The agent’s Python implementation could simply be wrong relative to the hidden unit tests (edge cases, formula, input validation, return type, etc.). The “failed: true” metadata is fully consistent with ordinary coding mistakes. Also, even if the prompt includes UI clarifications, the evaluation harness for a Python-function benchmark would still likely only run Python tests; the extra text would be irrelevant.
