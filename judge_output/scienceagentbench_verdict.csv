Why I doubt this is an intrinsic benchmark defect:
- OGGM missing: The task text (per Eval 4) explicitly warns that the *development sandbox* blocks OGGM imports and that the *evaluation Docker container* has OGGM installed, and instructs to write code as if imports work. Therefore, repeated ModuleNotFoundError in the sandbox is not evidence the benchmark/evaluator environment is broken; it is consistent with the stated setup. A capable agent could comply by not trying to run OGGM in the sandbox and simply producing the final script.
- Filename contradiction: The evidence only shows the prompt contains two save-path instructions. That is ambiguous, but not irrefutably impossible: a solution can save the same figure to both filenames (two savefig calls) or the evaluator may accept either. There is no concrete evidence the grading harness requires exactly one specific filename and rejects the other. Thus it’s not “overwhelming, irrefutable” that no agent could pass.

Alternative explanations: agent behavior (executing in the wrong environment; not choosing a robust workaround like saving to both paths) can fully explain failure.

Final determination: insufficient proof of a genuine benchmark/evaluation defect that would prevent any competent agent from succeeding."

Why I doubt it: This evidence only shows that the *tool sandbox used in these runs* lacked OGGM. That is not, by itself, an intrinsic benchmark formation error. In fact, Evaluation 2 explicitly notes the task statement says the development sandbox blocks OGGM imports but the evaluation Docker has OGGM installed—i.e., the benchmark is designed so agents should write code “as if imports work” even if they can’t execute it locally. That points to an agent/workflow limitation in the interactive environment, not a defect in the benchmark’s actual evaluation setup.

Alternative explanations: A capable agent could still succeed by producing correct OGGM-based code without executing it in the sandbox (since grading may occur in a different container where OGGM exists). Or the agent could avoid relying on runtime execution during drafting. The repeated import failures do not prove the evaluation harness/container used for scoring lacks OGGM.

Final determination: Not irrefutable evidence of a benchmark defect; it’s consistent with a known dev-sandbox restriction. Therefore, grade 0."

Why I doubt it’s an IFE: The task explicitly states the development sandbox blocks these imports and that the evaluation Docker container has Python 3.10, TensorFlow 2.17, and DeepChem configured. So the observed errors are consistent with a known sandbox limitation, not a defect in the benchmark’s actual evaluation environment. The .pkl inspection/open restrictions are also tool limitations during development, not evidence the evaluation harness can’t read the files.

Alternative explanations: The agent could have succeeded by not attempting to execute DeepChem in the sandbox and instead outputting the required final Python code. One evaluation also notes a formatting/parsing failure (missing fenced code block), which is clearly agent-side.

Final determination: No irrefutable evidence of an intrinsic benchmark/evaluation defect; failures are attributable to agent behavior and sandbox constraints. Grade 0."

Why I doubt it: Two independent evaluations explicitly cite the task’s own clarification that the *development sandbox* blocks these imports, while the *actual evaluation Docker container* includes Python 3.10, TensorFlow 2.17, DGL, and DeepChem CGCNN. That directly undercuts the “intrinsic benchmark defect” claim: the observed ModuleNotFoundError is in the tool/sandbox used for interactive testing, not necessarily in the benchmark’s grading environment.

Alternative explanations: The agent could have followed instructions and produced code without attempting to execute DeepChem in the sandbox (or used stubs / deferred execution), and the solution would run in the evaluation container. The failure is consistent with agent process error (repeatedly running blocked imports) rather than an unsatisfiable benchmark.

Final determination: No irrefutable evidence of an evaluation-environment defect. The only concrete evidence is a known sandbox limitation explicitly documented by the task, so this does not meet the bar for an Intrinsic Formation Error."

Why I doubt this is an IFE: The task itself explicitly states that the development sandbox blocks DeepPurpose imports and that DeepPurpose will be available in the evaluation Docker container, instructing agents to write code “as if imports work.” That makes the observed sandbox import failure an expected limitation, not a benchmark defect.

Alternative explanations: The agent could have succeeded by (1) not attempting to run DeepPurpose-dependent code in the sandbox, (2) only testing non-DeepPurpose components locally, and (3) outputting the final required code for the evaluation container. Nothing here shows the evaluation container is missing dependencies or that the grader rejects valid solutions.

Why I doubt this is an IFE: The evidence provided only shows failures inside the run transcript’s execution tooling/sandbox, not inside the actual benchmark evaluation container. In fact, the prompt text (as quoted in Eval 3) explicitly acknowledges this split: “The development sandbox blocks these imports, but the evaluation Docker container has TensorFlow 2.17, DeepChem, RDKit, and DGL properly configured.” If that’s true, then import failures during interactive tool calls are expected and are not a defect in the benchmark’s scoring environment.

Alternative explanations: The agent should have proceeded by writing the required code without relying on executing it in the restricted sandbox (i.e., treat tool execution failures as non-indicative), since the benchmark evaluates in a different container. A sufficiently capable agent could still produce correct code that would run in the evaluation Docker.

Final determination: The provided evidence does not irrefutably show a benchmark/evaluation defect—only a mismatch between the interactive sandbox and the stated evaluation environment, which appears intentional/communicated. Therefore, no proven intrinsic formation error."

Why I doubt it is an IFE: the task explicitly warns that the development sandbox blocks MODNet imports and instructs the solver to write code assuming imports work because the evaluation Docker container will install MODNet when it detects the imports. That means sandbox execution failures are expected and not evidence of a broken benchmark. The additional failures (regex/code-block not found, unterminated triple-quote SyntaxErrors) are clearly agent formatting/tooling mistakes.

Alternative explanations: a capable agent could simply stop running code in the sandbox and output a single valid Python code block with the required imports, letting the evaluation container handle dependencies. Nothing here shows the evaluation harness would reject a correct solution or that requirements are contradictory/impossible.

Final determination: no irrefutable benchmark defect is demonstrated; failures are attributable to agent strategy/formatting. Grade 0."
