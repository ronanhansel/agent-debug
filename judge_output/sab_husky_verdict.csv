Why I doubt it’s an IFE: The task explicitly states the development sandbox blocks these imports and that the evaluation Docker container has Python 3.10, TensorFlow 2.17, and DeepChem configured. So the observed errors are consistent with a known sandbox limitation, not a defect in the benchmark’s actual evaluation environment. The .pkl inspection/open restrictions are also tool limitations during development, not evidence the evaluation harness can’t read the files.

Alternative explanations: The agent could have succeeded by not attempting to execute DeepChem in the sandbox and instead outputting the required final Python code. One evaluation also notes a formatting/parsing failure (missing fenced code block), which is clearly agent-side.

Final determination: No irrefutable evidence of an intrinsic benchmark/evaluation defect; failures are attributable to agent behavior and sandbox constraints. Grade 0."

Why I doubt it: This evidence only shows that the *tool sandbox used in these runs* lacked OGGM. That is not, by itself, an intrinsic benchmark formation error. In fact, Evaluation 2 explicitly notes the task statement says the development sandbox blocks OGGM imports but the evaluation Docker has OGGM installed—i.e., the benchmark is designed so agents should write code “as if imports work” even if they can’t execute it locally. That points to an agent/workflow limitation in the interactive environment, not a defect in the benchmark’s actual evaluation setup.

Alternative explanations: A capable agent could still succeed by producing correct OGGM-based code without executing it in the sandbox (since grading may occur in a different container where OGGM exists). Or the agent could avoid relying on runtime execution during drafting. The repeated import failures do not prove the evaluation harness/container used for scoring lacks OGGM.

Final determination: Not irrefutable evidence of a benchmark defect; it’s consistent with a known dev-sandbox restriction. Therefore, grade 0."

Why I doubt it: Three independent evaluations note the task explicitly warns that the *development sandbox* blocks DeepPurpose imports, while the *evaluation Docker* has DeepPurpose installed and the agent should “write code as if imports work.” That means ModuleNotFoundError in the sandbox is expected and not evidence of a benchmark defect. The .tab/`open()` restrictions are likewise properties of the interactive tool, not necessarily the evaluation container; and in any case the task’s intended solution path is to write final code for the evaluation environment, not to successfully execute it in the sandbox.

Alternative explanations: The agent repeatedly tried to run DeepPurpose code in the sandbox despite the warning. A capable agent could comply by outputting correct code without executing DeepPurpose in the sandbox (and, if needed, only testing non-DeepPurpose logic). There is no concrete evidence that the evaluation container actually lacks DeepPurpose or that the official evaluation harness would reject a valid solution.

Final determination: Not irrefutable. The observed failures are consistent with agent workflow errors in the dev sandbox, not an intrinsic formation error in the benchmark."

Why I doubt this is an intrinsic benchmark defect:
- OGGM missing: The task text (per Eval 4) explicitly warns that the *development sandbox* blocks OGGM imports and that the *evaluation Docker container* has OGGM installed, and instructs to write code as if imports work. Therefore, repeated ModuleNotFoundError in the sandbox is not evidence the benchmark/evaluator environment is broken; it is consistent with the stated setup. A capable agent could comply by not trying to run OGGM in the sandbox and simply producing the final script.
- Filename contradiction: The evidence only shows the prompt contains two save-path instructions. That is ambiguous, but not irrefutably impossible: a solution can save the same figure to both filenames (two savefig calls) or the evaluator may accept either. There is no concrete evidence the grading harness requires exactly one specific filename and rejects the other. Thus it’s not “overwhelming, irrefutable” that no agent could pass.

Alternative explanations: agent behavior (executing in the wrong environment; not choosing a robust workaround like saving to both paths) can fully explain failure.

Final determination: insufficient proof of a genuine benchmark/evaluation defect that would prevent any competent agent from succeeding."

Why I doubt this is an intrinsic benchmark defect: the evidence only shows a mismatch in the *development/tooling sandbox used in these runs*, not necessarily the actual *evaluation container* that scores submissions. In fact, Evaluation 4 explicitly notes the development sandbox blocks imports but the evaluation Docker is properly configured—this directly undercuts the claim that “no agent could succeed” in the real benchmark. A task can be solvable in the evaluation environment even if the interactive sandbox used for agent traces lacks dependencies.

Alternative explanations: (1) The benchmark is correct and the evaluation container truly has TF/DeepChem; the agent should write code assuming imports work (as instructed) without needing to execute it in the sandbox. (2) The agent could still complete the task by providing correct code without runtime verification. (3) The observed failures could be an artifact of the tool environment, not the benchmark harness.

Final determination: Not irrefutable evidence of an IFE in the benchmark/evaluation setup itself; it’s consistent with a separate sandbox limitation. Under the rubric’s high bar, grade 0."

Why I doubt it / alternative explanation: The task itself (per the evaluations) explicitly warns that the *development sandbox* blocks MODNet imports, and that the *evaluation Docker container* will install MODNet if the required import lines are present. That means `ModuleNotFoundError` during interactive tool execution is expected and not evidence that the benchmark’s actual grading environment is broken. Multiple runs indicate the agent kept trying to execute code in the sandbox despite this warning, and also failed output formatting (missing required markdown code block / syntax errors from embedding markdown in triple-quoted strings). Those are agent strategy/formatting failures, not an intrinsic benchmark defect.

No irrefutable evidence is provided that the evaluation container (the one that matters for scoring) truly cannot install/import MODNet or that the harness rejects valid solutions. Therefore, there is not overwhelming proof of an Intrinsic Formation Error."

Why I doubt it: Three of four evaluations explicitly note the task’s own clarification that the *development sandbox* blocks TensorFlow/DeepChem imports, while the *evaluation Docker container* (the real grading environment) has TensorFlow 2.17, DGL, and DeepChem CGCNN configured. The observed failures are therefore consistent with an agent incorrectly trying to execute in the sandbox, not evidence that the benchmark’s evaluation environment is broken.

Alternative explanations: A capable agent could follow instructions, avoid sandbox execution, and simply write the required code assuming imports work in the evaluation container. Nothing here shows missing benchmark files, contradictory requirements, or an evaluation harness that rejects valid solutions.

Final determination: The evidence only demonstrates a known sandbox limitation and agent misuse of it, not an intrinsic formation error in the benchmark/evaluation setup. Grade 0."
