Why I accept it (skeptically): Multiple independent evaluations report the same minimal input and the same core defect: there is nothing to transform/extract into “ONLY one python function,” and the instruction “Do NOT add or change any functionality” becomes impossible to satisfy because there is no existing functionality to preserve. If the hidden grader expects a specific function name/signature/behavior, that target is not derivable from the provided prompt, making success non-deterministic (guessing).

Alternative explanations considered: Some agents also violated formatting (multiple functions/classes). That can explain those particular failures, but it does not resolve the underlying problem: even a perfectly compliant agent outputting a single stub would still be arbitrary and very likely fail any specific unit tests. There is no workaround (e.g., infer signature from context) because no context is present.

Final determination: Overwhelming evidence of intrinsic underspecification/empty prompt content that prevents any agent from reliably producing the uniquely expected solution. This is an Intrinsic Formation Error."

Why I accept it as an IFE: If the benchmark truly provides only that text, then there is no well-defined target to implement. Hidden tests would necessarily expect a specific function name/signature/behavior, but none of that is inferable from the prompt. This is not merely “hard” or “ambiguous”; it is structurally underspecified such that any solution would be an arbitrary guess and cannot be reliably derived from the given input.

Alternative explanations considered: (a) The agent could just implement a trivial function (e.g., return None) and pass—implausible for a scientific coding benchmark with meaningful tests. (b) The missing context might exist outside the shown trace—possible in general, but the evaluations consistently report the user content contains only the error message and nothing else, and multiple independent runs flag underspecification. (c) The failures could be due to agents outputting stubs—true for some runs, but even a perfect agent cannot reconstruct the required API/behavior from the provided prompt.

Final determination: Overwhelming evidence of intrinsic underspecification in the task formation (missing required function identity/spec), which would prevent any agent from deterministically producing the expected implementation."

(2) Why I accept it: This is not merely “hard” or “ambiguous”; it is missing the minimum specification needed to define a unique correct target. Any concrete function (name/args/body) would be invented. If the hidden tests expect a specific function name/signature/behavior, there is no way to infer it from the provided input. That is an intrinsic formation defect (underspecified task) rather than an agent mistake.

(3) Alternative explanations considered: Some runs failed due to formatting (multiple functions/blocks). However, even a perfectly compliant agent outputting exactly one function would still be guessing the required API/behavior. A workaround (e.g., raising NotImplementedError) cannot be guaranteed to satisfy hidden tests unless the benchmark is explicitly testing for that, which is not stated.

Why I doubt it: underspecification alone is not irrefutable evidence of a benchmark defect. Many SciCode-style tasks intentionally provide minimal context and still have a valid expected output (e.g., implement a generic placeholder function, or the hidden tests may only check formatting/structure, or expect a conventional NotImplementedError stub). We are not shown the actual unit tests or harness expectations, so we cannot prove that *no* agent could pass. The “must not add/change functionality” constraint is also not necessarily contradictory here: if the intended task is simply to output a minimal function consistent with the message (e.g., raising NotImplementedError), that can be seen as preserving the only “functionality” implied by the input.

Alternative explanations: the repeated failures across runs are well-explained by agent noncompliance with the strict output format (multiple code blocks/functions, extra text) and/or choosing an implementation that didn’t match hidden expectations. A sufficiently careful agent could output exactly one function in one code fence and choose a conservative implementation.

Final determination: evidence does not meet the bar for an IFE (no concrete proof of contradictory requirements or a harness that rejects all valid solutions). Grade 0."

Yet the system instruction expects returning “only a python function” while “not add[ing] or change[ing] any functionality,” implying there is a concrete target function to extract/clean.

(2) Why I accept it: With zero scaffold (no identifier, args, return contract, or described computation), there is no principled way to produce the uniquely correct function that hidden tests would expect. Any output (stub, NotImplementedError, pass, etc.) is pure guesswork. This is not merely “hard”; it is missing the essential specification needed for a deterministic, testable solution.

(3) Alternatives considered: Some evaluators argue an agent could output a minimal stub and satisfy formatting. That might satisfy the *format* constraint, but it does not address correctness under a benchmark with hidden tests expecting a specific function. Since the task text provides no way to infer that expected function, a sufficiently capable agent still cannot reliably pass.

(4) Final determination: Overwhelming evidence of intrinsic underspecification/scaffolding failure in the benchmark item itself (no implementable target), so this is an IFE."

Yet the system requires returning exactly one Python function and (implicitly, for scicode) the solution must satisfy hidden tests.

Why I accept it as an IFE: this is not merely “hard” or “vague”; it is missing the minimum information needed to define a unique target. Any hidden tests must be calling a specific function name/signature and checking specific semantics. With zero identifiers or behavioral spec in the task text, there is no principled way for any agent to infer what to implement. Producing a stub (pass/NotImplementedError) might satisfy formatting but cannot be expected to satisfy unknown tests; conversely, guessing a name/signature is arbitrary. That is intrinsic underspecification in the benchmark item.

Alternative explanations considered: Several runs failed due to agents violating the ‘only one function’ formatting constraint. However, even a perfectly compliant agent outputting a single function would still be forced to guess the interface/behavior, so success would be luck, not solvable from provided information. This points to a benchmark formation defect rather than agent capability.

Why this is not irrefutable IFE evidence: underspecification alone does not prove the benchmark is defective unless we can show the hidden tests require a specific, unguessable implementation. From the provided evidence, we do not see the reference solution, the unit tests, or any harness constraints beyond “output one Python function.” It is entirely plausible the intended correct output is simply a stub that raises NotImplementedError (or a minimal placeholder), which *is* derivable from the prompt. Thus it is not provably impossible for a capable agent to succeed.

Alternative explanations: (1) The benchmark may accept any single-function placeholder (e.g., raising NotImplementedError) and the agents failed mainly by violating the strict output-format constraint (multiple code blocks / extra text), as multiple evaluations document. (2) The task could be a formatting compliance check rather than a functional implementation task.

Final determination: there is no overwhelming, concrete proof of a benchmark/evaluation defect that would block all agents. The observed failures are readily explained by agent noncompliance and/or choosing an incorrect placeholder, so grade 0."

(2) Why I accept it as an IFE: In this benchmark format, the agent is supposed to return the (cleaned) target function from provided code. Here there is no target function to extract or repair, and no determinate spec to implement. Any output necessarily invents a name/signature/semantics. If the hidden tests expect a specific function name/signature/behavior, the prompt gives zero information to infer it, making correctness unachievable in principle.

(3) Alternatives considered: Some evaluators argue “a stub could satisfy structural requirements.” But the benchmark is scored by hidden correctness, not merely by producing any single function. Without a specified API, a ‘better agent’ cannot reliably match the evaluator’s expected function. Agent formatting mistakes (multiple code blocks) are real, but they don’t resolve the core issue: even a perfectly formatted single-function response would still be a guess with no grounding.

(2) Why I accept it: For this benchmark type, the system constraints typically require returning exactly one Python function while not changing functionality. If the prompt truly provides no function to transform and no specification of what to implement, then there is no determinate target: any concrete function name/signature/behavior would be invented. If the hidden grader expects a specific function (name/signature/semantics), success becomes impossible from the provided information alone. Multiple independent evaluators report the same missing-scaffold condition.

(3) Alternative explanations considered: It could be that the grader accepts any stub (e.g., a generic function raising NotImplementedError) or that the expected output is simply a placeholder. However, the task text explicitly says “Please implement the required function manually,” which implies a non-placeholder implementation, and there is no way to infer what that implementation should be. Also, even if an agent could satisfy formatting (one function), that would not address the core issue of matching an unknown expected interface/behavior.
