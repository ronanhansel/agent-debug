Yet the system requires returning exactly one Python function and (implicitly) the hidden evaluator likely expects a specific function/signature/behavior.

(2) Why I accept it: This is not merely “ambiguous”; it is missing the minimum information needed to define a unique target. Without the method name/signature and required semantics, there is no deterministic way for any agent to produce the evaluator’s expected function. Multiple independent evaluations (5,6,9,10,11,12) converge on the same concrete deficiency and cite the same minimal prompt content.

(3) Alternative explanations considered: Some runs failed due to format noncompliance (multiple functions/classes, missing code fences). However, even a perfectly compliant agent outputting a single stub function would be guessing; unless the evaluator accepts any arbitrary stub (unlikely for a coding benchmark), the task remains unsolvable as specified. The “scicode” runs about Schrödinger/Hartree appear to be from a different task context and don’t rebut the underspecification evidence for Task ID 12.

(4) Final determination: Overwhelming evidence of an intrinsic benchmark formation error (underspecified/absent required code context), making correct completion impossible to infer reliably. Grade=1."

Why I accept it (skeptically): Multiple independent runs (Eval 9/10/11/14) report the same structural absence of any implementable specification. If the benchmark’s hidden tests expect a specific function name/signature/behavior, then omitting that information makes a correct solution impossible in principle: any output is an arbitrary guess and cannot be reliably matched to the harness.

Alternative explanations considered:
- Agent failure (returning NotImplementedError / pass / wrong format): plausible in individual runs, but doesn’t resolve the core problem that the prompt provides zero actionable requirements. Even a perfect agent cannot infer the exact required interface/behavior from the provided text alone.
- Harness expects a generic placeholder function: possible, but then the benchmark would need to specify that (e.g., “define required_function(*args, **kwargs) returning None”). The evaluations indicate it does not.

Note: One evaluation (Eval 4) alleges an import-stripping/np NameError issue in a different-looking scicode diffraction task; that evidence is not consistent across runs and is not needed for the verdict.

Final determination: Overwhelming evidence of intrinsic underspecification in the task materials (at least for the scicode_lady version), making correct completion non-identifiable and thus an IFE."

Why I accept it (skeptically): Multiple independent evals (4, 8, 11) point to the same concrete defect: there is no implementable target. This is not merely “hard” or “ambiguous”; it is missing the essential artifact the benchmark format presupposes (a function to sanitize/return). In such a setup, any produced function (name, args, semantics) is necessarily invented and cannot be validated against hidden tests in a principled way. The non-modification constraint (“Do NOT add or change any functionality inside the functions”) becomes impossible to satisfy when there is no function provided.

Alternative explanations considered: Could the agent simply output a stub (e.g., `def f(): pass`) and pass? Unlikely—these benchmarks typically have hidden tests expecting a specific function signature/behavior. With no signature given, even a perfectly formatted single-function response is guesswork. Could the missing context exist outside the shown trace? Possible in general, but the evidence here is that the *benchmark input* to the agent (as recorded) is only the error comments; if the harness expected something else, that itself is a formation error (truncated/empty prompt payload).

Why this is an IFE (and not just agent failure): Multiple independent runs (5,7,10,11) report the same structural problem: there is no target function/method to extract/repair and no specification that could uniquely determine what the grader expects. In such a setup, any produced function name/signature/behavior is necessarily a guess. That is a benchmark formation defect (missing essential problem statement), not a solvable coding task.

Skeptical alternatives considered:
- “A capable agent could output a minimal stub function and pass.” This is not credible without evidence that the hidden tests accept arbitrary stubs or arbitrary names/signatures. Typical scicode tasks test specific function names/signatures; with none provided, passing is not reliably achievable.
- “Failures are due to formatting (multiple functions, comments).” Some agents indeed violated formatting, but that does not resolve the core issue: even perfectly formatted output cannot be confidently correct when the required function is unspecified.

Final determination: Overwhelming evidence of intrinsic underspecification/missing scaffold. This is a genuine benchmark/task formation error that prevents any agent from deterministically producing the expected solution."

Why I accept it as an IFE: Multiple independent evaluations (5,7,8,9,10,11,12,14) report the same core fact: the prompt provides no implementable target beyond an abstract statement.

This is not merely “hard” or “ambiguous”; it is missing the essential scaffold needed to define correctness.

Alternative explanations considered:
- Agent noncompliance (multiple functions / extra text) explains some individual run failures, but does not resolve the underlying impossibility: even a perfectly compliant agent returning exactly one function would still be guessing the name/signature/behavior and would almost surely fail hidden tests.
- Could the evaluator accept any stub? Unlikely for SciCode-style tasks; and nothing in the provided task text indicates that a stub is acceptable or that the function name is arbitrary.

(2) Why I accept it as an IFE: Under the stated scicode constraint (“output exactly one Python function, don’t add/change functionality”), there is no uniquely determined target to implement. Any concrete function name/signature/behavior is guesswork. If hidden tests expect a specific method (name/signature/semantics), no agent can reliably satisfy them from this prompt alone. This is not merely ‘hard’; it is missing the essential specification needed to define correctness.

(3) Alternative explanations considered: Some evaluators argue an agent could still ‘comply’ by outputting a single stub (e.g., raising NotImplementedError). But that only satisfies formatting, not the benchmark’s implied goal of implementing the required method; and it would almost certainly fail functional hidden tests that require the real method. The repeated pattern of agents producing different plausible placeholders (self vs no self, args/kwargs, different names) is exactly what you’d expect from an underspecified benchmark item.

(4) Final determination: Overwhelming evidence of intrinsic underspecification/missing scaffold. Even though several individual runs also failed due to formatting (multiple functions / missing fences), the underlying task as presented is not well-posed or verifiable.

(2) Why I accept it: If the hidden evaluator expects a specific function name/signature/semantics, that target is not inferable from the provided input. This is not mere difficulty: it is missing essential information required to produce a determinate solution. Multiple evaluators (7, 10, 14, and also 9’s existence_reasoning) independently report the same concrete absence of specification.

(3) Alternative explanations considered: Could a capable agent still pass by outputting any single stub? Only if the benchmark’s tests accept arbitrary stubs or do not check name/signature/behavior. But the repeated failures across agents despite trying common stubs (pass / raise NotImplementedError; with/without self; varying names) strongly suggest the harness expects something specific. With no grounding, success would be guesswork, not solvable by capability.

Alternative explanations considered: Some runs (1–3) discuss a completely different scientific-computing task involving NumPy/gaussian optics and code-fence parsing, suggesting there may be dataset mix-ups across “scicode” vs “scicode_lady” tracks. However, the majority of evaluations for Task 28 consistently describe the same minimal error-only prompt. Even if some agents also violated formatting (multiple functions), that does not remove the underlying impossibility: with no signature/spec, a perfectly compliant single-function output would still be a guess and could not reliably match the evaluator.
