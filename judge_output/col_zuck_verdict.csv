Why I doubt any IFE: The only potential concern is that the three evaluations describe different intended behaviors for mismatched categories (union-with-zeros vs ignore vs raise ValueError). But this is not evidence of a benchmark defect—it's evidence that different runs may have had different user clarifications or that evaluators are summarizing different transcripts. Without the actual prompt/test harness showing contradictory requirements within the same task instance, this does not prove an impossible or self-contradictory benchmark.

Alternative explanations: The recorded failures could be due to agent mistakes, formatting/packaging issues, wrong function signature/name, or simply that the agent followed a different mismatch-keys policy than the hidden tests expected. A sufficiently capable agent could ask/resolve the mismatch behavior (as implied by the dialogues) and implement accordingly.

It also notes the agent computed years_left but didn’t use it.

Why I doubt this is an IFE: Ambiguity alone is not irrefutable evidence of a benchmark defect, and here it’s not even clear the benchmark requires year_target to change the numeric output. A reasonable interpretation consistent with “total amount to cut by the target year” is simply current_emissions * reduction_percentage/100, regardless of years. If the benchmark expects that, the task is perfectly solvable. If the benchmark expects a time-dependent quantity (e.g., annual cut), a capable agent could ask one more clarifying question and implement accordingly.

Alternative explanations: (1) Agent failure: ignoring year_target despite user emphasis (as in Eval 1). (2) Hidden test expectation mismatch (return remaining emissions vs cut amount, or annualized cut), which would be a spec/agent alignment issue but not proven to be an intrinsic harness defect. No concrete evidence is provided of contradictory tests or an evaluation harness rejecting valid solutions.

If those details are indeed in the transcript, the task is not intrinsically underdefined; it is solvable with straightforward parsing/normalization.

Alternative explanations: (1) Eval 3 may be referencing a different/partial transcript or misreading the dialogue. (2) The agent could have failed by hard-coding or by not matching exact normalization/edge cases—agent fault, not benchmark defect.

There is no evidence of contradictory instructions, impossible constraints, or a harness behavior that would reject a correct solution.

Alternative explanations: Any failure could easily be due to agent-side mistakes—e.g., returning the wrong default string (""Unknown"" vs ""no color found""), not fully normalizing internal whitespace, not matching exact expected output strings, or formatting/IO mismatches required by the harness.

Why I doubt it: Evaluation 1 cites concrete clarifications from the dialogue that *do* pin down key requirements: ad_type is a dict containing 'revenue_per_ad'; both 'revenue_per_ad' and 'click_revenue' apply and should be multiplied; ad_duration must be included; return float; no validation. That largely removes the alleged missing mapping problem (there is no external mapping if the dict already contains the needed value). The remaining ambiguity (exact placement of probability, whether duration scales click component vs total, etc.) is not shown to be provably impossible—it's the kind of detail a capable agent could resolve by asking more targeted questions or by matching common-sense interpretations.

Alternative explanations: The agent may simply have chosen a formula that doesn't match the benchmark's intended one (e.g., probability applied to clicks vs ads, duration applied only to impression revenue, additive vs multiplicative structure). That is an agent-side mismatch, not irrefutable evidence the benchmark is defective.

The described solution (sorted(..., key=lambda r: r[2], reverse=True)) is standard and should pass under the stated requirements.

Alternative explanations: If the run was marked incorrect, it could easily be due to agent-side mismatch with hidden harness expectations (e.g., required function name/signature, in-place sort vs return, strict output formatting, handling of non-numeric ratings, stable sort requirements, or additional constraints not captured in the evaluator summaries).

Why I doubt an IFE: There is no irrefutable contradiction or impossibility shown. The only potential problem hinted is inconsistency across runs about rounding semantics (one mentions truncation, another “nearest minute,” another says rounding method is flexible). But this is not demonstrated as a benchmark/evaluator contradiction—it's more likely different dialogue variants or evaluator paraphrases. Even if the dialogue were slightly ambiguous (round vs floor), that’s not automatically an IFE unless the harness enforces an unstated rule that makes the task unsolvable; no such proof is provided.

The described task—compute shelters_needed via ceiling division of len(displaced_persons) by capacity_per_shelter, then compare to num_shelters and return either an int or 'Not enough shelters'—is straightforward.

Alternative explanations: Any failure is plausibly agent-side: incorrect ceiling division, wrong comparison, mishandling edge cases (empty list, invalid inputs), or returning/raising different error behavior than tests expect.

66,1,1,2,col_zuck_openai_gpt-4_1_WITH_DIALOGUES;col_zuck_openai_o4-mini_high_WITH_DIALOGUES,"Claimed issue: The prompt for Task 66 mixes two unrelated specifications: (a) a backend Python function `calculate_mineral_remaining(...)` about cave minerals, and (b) an ""IMPORTANT CLARIFICATIONS"" block that is clearly about a frontend travel UI layout (two-section layout, destination image, ""Filter and Sort"", ""Travel Packages""). Additionally, the mineral task itself lacks a defined mapping from depth to total minerals and lacks an explicit rule for negative remaining (clamp vs allow negative), and the dialogue shows the user explicitly cannot provide these missing rules.

Why I accept it as an IFE: The UI-layout clarifications are not merely irrelevant; they are from a different task domain and directly indicate prompt contamination. That is a benchmark formation defect. Separately, the core computation is underdetermined: without a specified conversion from depth to total minerals (or any other way to derive total minerals), there is no unique correct function behavior. The dialogue further cements that the benchmark cannot rely on “ask the user” to resolve ambiguity because the user says they don’t know and asks the agent to assume defaults. If the hidden tests expect a particular constant or clamping policy, that expectation would be ungrounded in the provided spec.

Alternative explanations considered: Could a strong agent still pass by guessing the benchmark’s intended defaults? Possibly, but that would be luck, not derivation from the task. The presence of cross-task UI instructions is strong, concrete evidence of mis-formed input, and the missing depth→minerals rule makes any deterministic grading inherently arbitrary.

Why I doubt this is an IFE: Irrelevant extra text does not by itself create a provably impossible or contradictory requirement. A capable agent can (and should) ignore unrelated frontend requirements and still implement the specified Python function. There is no concrete evidence that the evaluation harness actually tests for any frontend artifact or that the hidden tests are tied to the contaminated portion. The only hard evidence is that one agent failed; that is fully consistent with agent-side issues (wrong formula/normalization, wrong weights, formatting/preamble, etc.). Evaluation 2 explicitly notes such agent-side problems.

Alternative explanations: Hidden tests likely check for a specific formula/normalization derived from the dialogue (e.g., exact weights, clamping to 0–100, type handling). If the agent deviated (e.g., weights not matching, rescaling, extra text, missing constraints), it would fail even with a perfectly well-formed benchmark. The presence of unrelated frontend text could be harmless noise rather than a test mismatch.

Why I doubt it: Two independent evaluations (1 and 2) report the opposite: the dialogue fully specifies categories, matching rules (case-insensitive, substring match for 'purple' eyes), attribute names, trait format (list), and default behavior when no rule matches. If that is accurate, the task is not intrinsically ambiguous; it is implementable.

Alternative explanations: The failing agent could have (a) misused the preferences argument, (b) implemented exact equality instead of substring/case-insensitive matching, (c) mishandled trait lists, (d) returned the wrong output schema (e.g., 'Other' vs 'Uncategorized'), or (e) applied rule precedence incorrectly.

Evidence threshold: Eval 3’s argument is speculative (“likely relies on undisclosed rules”) and conflicts with concrete-sounding specifications cited in Eval 1.

Why I doubt it: The evidence is inconsistent across runs. One evaluation states the user provided explicit weights (2,3,5) and a clear signature, which would substantially reduce underdefinition. Even if ranges are unknown, a benchmark can still define a deterministic mapping (e.g., clamp to [0,100], linear scaling, etc.) that a capable agent could infer by asking the right clarifying questions or by adhering strictly to the provided signature and weights. Underdefinition alone is not an IFE unless it is provably impossible to deduce the expected behavior; here that is not shown.
