Why I doubt any IFE: The reported failures are all consistent with agent mistakes. One agent targeted a non-existent path (yocto-vars.py) despite the checkout being Sphinx; others misused the interface (trying to use Python open/imports, sending diff text to a Python interpreter, producing placeholder hash diffs, failing required output formatting). None of this shows an impossible task, missing dependency that cannot be worked around, contradictory requirements, or a harness rejecting a valid solution.

Alternative explanations considered: A competent agent could search the Sphinx repo for the relevant include/source-read behavior, implement a code change, run tests, and output a real git diff. The existence of navigable repo structure and successful file location in at least one run argues against missing files or a broken environment.

None of the logs show a reproducible harness behavior that would reject a correct patch, nor a missing dependency, broken tests, or contradictory requirements.

Alternative explanations: A competent agent could (1) use ripgrep via execute_bash to find the warning emission site, (2) implement a small conditional to suppress warnings for genindex/modindex/search targets, (3) run tests or at least lint, and (4) output a real git diff from the modified repo.

At least one evaluation explicitly shows the file is accessible and readable via sed and even includes the relevant code snippet from django/db/models/fields/__init__.py.

That is not an IFE because the benchmark clearly provides proper repo-interaction tools (bash/search/edit) and at least one run successfully read the target file contents, demonstrating the task is workable without forbidden imports. Likewise, the repeated ""code parsing"" regex errors reflect a protocol the agent failed to follow, not an evaluator that rejects valid solutions.

Alternative explanations: A capable agent could (and in other SWE-bench tasks typically does) use the provided tools to inspect the repository, apply edits with correct line numbers, run tests, and output a valid unified diff.

Evals 2–4 also give plausible, specific agent-caused failure modes (tool misuse, wrong working directory assumptions, incorrect patch paths) that can fully explain “can’t find files” without implying a broken benchmark.

Alternative explanations: The agents in the failing runs likely searched from the wrong directory or used the wrong tool invocation (e.g., calling a search tool inside a Python interpreter, or looking for `django/contrib/...` instead of `django/django/contrib/...`). That can easily produce the appearance of a tiny file set and missing modules while the repo is actually present.

Multiple runs successfully located the relevant Django source (django/django/contrib/admin/options.py) and the specific behavioral inconsistency (formfield_for_manytomany overwriting a user-provided widget). That strongly suggests the task is well-formed and solvable.

Alternative explanations considered: The only “blocking” behavior shown is the agents repeatedly failing to comply with the interface’s expected output/tool-call format and sometimes targeting a non-existent path (django/contrib/admin/options.py). A sufficiently capable agent could edit the correct file, generate a proper unified diff (via git diff), and submit it correctly.

Alternative explanations: The consistent failures are readily attributable to agent behavior: not opening the target file, outputting diffs against incorrect paths (sphinx/util/... vs sphinx/sphinx/util/...), inventing functions/tests without verifying repository contents, and not running tests.

Why I doubt an IFE: The only “systemic” problem shown is that the platform expects a particular fenced code block pattern (```python/```py) and rejects other formats (e.g., ```diff). That is an interface requirement, not an intrinsic impossibility or contradiction in the benchmark. A capable agent can comply by placing the diff in an accepted code fence (or by using the tools to edit files and then output a proper unified diff in the required format). Similarly, the restriction on importing `sphinx` in a limited interpreter is a tool constraint that can be worked around by using shell commands/tests in the repo environment; it does not imply the task is unsolvable.

Alternative explanations considered: (1) The harness regex might incorrectly reject valid diffs.

Why I doubt/accept IFE: There is no irrefutable sign of an impossible requirement, contradictory spec, broken harness, or missing dependency that blocks all agents. The workspace clearly contained a Sphinx source tree, and the described target bug (Sphinx autodoc formatting) is plausible and historically solvable via normal code edits. Errors like “forbidden import/open” or parsing/regex failures appear to be violations of the agent’s allowed tool interface, not an evaluation harness rejecting valid solutions.

Alternative explanations considered: A competent agent could (1) recognize the correct repo (Sphinx), (2) use allowed tools (bash/edit_file) to inspect real files, (3) implement a real patch with correct context, and (4) run relevant tests/docs build. The repeated placeholder hashes, incorrect paths, and malformed diffs are sufficient to explain failures without invoking any benchmark defect.

Why I doubt it: Only one run reports this severe corruption; the other three do not corroborate any repo-level defect and instead attribute failure to agent tool misuse, wrong paths, and not actually inspecting/applying patches. Without direct, repeatable evidence (e.g., multiple independent inspections showing the same truncation in the checked-out file, or logs of failing tests in a clean environment), a single agent’s observation could be explained by: (a) reading the wrong file/path, (b) a tool/output artifact (e.g., transcript/prompt injection in the interface rather than the actual file on disk), (c) partial file display/command misuse, or (d) searching an incomplete subset of files.

Alternative explanation: The benchmark may use a Django version/state where the relevant logic exists under a different method name or backend-specific schema editor, and a capable agent could still implement the fix by locating equivalent code paths (constraint/index deletion helpers) and adding/regressing tests. The other evaluations describe agents failing to properly inspect the repo and generate/apply a real diff—consistent with agent failure rather than an impossible task.

Why I doubt it: Across all four runs, there is no concrete, repeatable evidence of a benchmark defect (missing files, broken checkout, contradictory requirements, failing tests in a clean state, or a harness bug that rejects correct solutions). At least one evaluation explicitly shows the relevant Django source files are accessible (e.g., django/django/forms/models.py, django/django/forms/widgets.py) and the agent even found the pertinent code path (ModelChoiceIterator yielding an empty label). The observed failures are dominated by agent/tool misuse: wrong file paths, regex syntax errors, attempting forbidden modules in the python tool, fabricating diffs/hashes/line numbers, and not producing an applicable unified diff.

Alternative explanations considered: (1) Tooling restrictions (e.g., forbidden imports) could be worked around by using permitted shell search/edit tools; other runs did access files, so not intrinsic. (2) Patch-format rejection could indicate harness strictness, but the evidence shows the agents generated malformed/unverified diffs; nothing indicates a correct diff would be rejected. (3) Repo layout confusion (django/django/...) is a common agent navigation error, not a benchmark defect.

The task description sounds coherent for Django (moving/synchronizing `use_required_attribute` logic between `ClearableFileInput` and `FileInput`).

Alternative explanations considered: The only “issue” hinted is an initial path mismatch (`django/forms/widgets.py` vs `django/django/forms/widgets.py`), but that is a normal repo layout detail and was discovered in-run; a competent agent can search for the file and proceed.

The cited errors (forbidden `open`, forbidden modules in python sandbox, inability to satisfy a code-fence regex for tool calls) are interface/tool-use constraints that competent agents routinely work around by using the provided repo tools correctly; they do not demonstrate that *no* valid patch could pass.

Alternative explanations considered: A better agent could (a) use the correct file inspection/edit tools instead of `python_interpreter` filesystem access, (b) follow the required tool-call formatting, (c) implement the multi-overload signature parsing and add tests, then output a real unified diff.
