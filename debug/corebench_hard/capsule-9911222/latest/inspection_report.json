  "analysis": "The run failed due to environmental barriers: missing system-level dependencies (Rscript, LaTeX toolchain) and unresolved R package dependencies. The user lacks permission to install system packages via apt, and although conda was used to install R, standard R packages (e.g., Matrix, MASS) and Bioconductor packages were unavailable, making PDF rendering mechanically unrunnable.",
  "rationale": "Evidence shows shell commands failing with 'Rscript: not found' and apt permission errors ('Unable to lock directory /var/lib/apt/lists/'), followed by conda installation of R (version 4.2.0) that still lacked base/standard (e.g. Matrix, MASS) and Bioconductor packages needed for the vignette. Additionally, the absence of LaTeX executables (pdflatex, latexmk) prevents PDF generation, as highlighted by multiple error traces indicating missing system executables and dependency installation failures.",
