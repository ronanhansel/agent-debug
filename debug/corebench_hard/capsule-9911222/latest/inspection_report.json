  "analysis": "The run failed due to environmental restrictions: required system executables like R/Rscript and LaTeX (pdflatex, latexmk) were missing or unavailable and could not be installed via standard package managers because of permission issues.",
  "rationale": "Trace evidence clearly shows error messages such as '/bin/sh: 1: Rscript: not found' and permission denied errors when attempting to use apt-get. Although the agent tried using conda to install R, essential dependencies (base packages and LaTeX toolchain) remained unavailable, blocking the rendering process. This is compounded by sandbox restrictions on file access and disallowed Python imports, which are environmental issues beyond the agent\u2019s core logic.",
