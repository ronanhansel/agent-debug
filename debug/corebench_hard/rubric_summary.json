Facts given in the task\n\n- The repository is code from a scientific paper, cloned to the current directory.\n- The high-level goal is to test computational reproducibility.\n- Need to create three directories in results: 01_scopus-selection, 02_coding, 03_analyses.\n- Required to run master_script.R with Rscript.\n- The questions to answer are:  \n  - From Figure 2 in the cleaned results, report the percentage of 'Not Available' analysis scripts for Pre-RC (2008-09).  \n  - From Table 1 in the cleaned results, report the number of Included Articles After.OS.\n- The expected answer is a Python dictionary with those exact questions as keys, values as the answers.\n- Must install requirements found in the Readme file.\n- The repo has a results folder.\n- The filename for the main script is master_script.R.\n\n### 1.2. Facts to look up\n\n- The exact dependencies/requirements listed in the README file (must be found and installed).\n  - Source: README file in the repo.\n- The location/expected output files or folders generated by master_script.R (e.g., where \"cleaned results,\" tables, or figures are found).\n  - Source: Possibly README, documentation, or inspecting script outputs after running.\n- The format and location of \"Figure 2\" and \"Table 1\" in the cleaned results (could be images, .csv, .xlsx, .pdf, or R-generated data files).\n  - Source: Output folders/files generated after master_script.R or documentation/scripts.\n- Exact names/labels for:\n  - 'Not Available' analysis scripts for Pre-RC (2008-09) in Figure 2.\n  - 'Included Articles After.OS' in Table 1.\n  - Source: Figure/table output file contents.\n- How to interpret/locate data points in Figure 2 and Table 1 (e.g., does Figure 2 provide data as a CSV, or only as a chart?).\n  - Source: Output files from the script.\n- Whether any additional setup is needed for Rscript to run (e.g., install system dependencies, ensure correct R version).\n  - Source: README, or error messages during execution.\n- Whether \"cleaned results\" refers to a specific file/folder or a collection of files.\n\n### 1.3. Facts to derive\n\n- The actual percentage of 'Not Available' analysis scripts for Pre-RC (2008-09) as shown in the relevant output (requires either reading numerical values from a table or extracting from a figure).\n- The count of 'Included Articles After.OS' from Table 1 in the cleaned results (requires reading the relevant value).\n- Possibly, paths to relevant files/tables/figures as derived from script output or documentation.\n- Validation that the script ran correctly and outputs were generated as expected.\n- Correct values to supply for the dictionary, mapped to the given question keys.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Plan\n\n1. Inspect the current directory structure to locate the README file and any other relevant documentation.\n2. Read the README file to determine the full list of dependencies/requirements and the procedure for running the analysis (including details on R, required packages, and data locations).\n3. Install any dependencies as specified in the README (both R and non-R, as needed).\n4. Create the following directories in the results folder: 01_scopus-selection, 02_coding, 03_analyses.\n5. Run master_script.R using Rscript, as instructed.\n6. After completion, examine the newly created/updated files and subfolders, focusing on any that refer to \"cleaned results,\" Table 1, and Figure 2.\n7. Determine the file(s) containing Figure 2 and Table 1 in the cleaned results, and in what format these results are provided (table, text, image, spreadsheet, etc.).\n8. Extract the percentage of 'Not Available' analysis scripts for Pre-RC (2008-09) from Figure 2 in the cleaned results.\n9. Extract the number of Included Articles After.OS from Table 1 in the cleaned results.\n10. Compose a Python dictionary with the required keys and results as values.\n11. Output the dictionary as the final answer.\n\n---\n\n### 1.1. Facts given in the task\n- We must create three directories inside the results folder: \n  - results/01_scopus-selection\n  - results/02_coding\n  - results/03_analyses\n- We must run the script named master_script.R using Rscript.\n- We must install all requirements listed in the repository\u2019s Readme before running.\n- We must extract two values from the \u201ccleaned results\u201d produced by the repository after running:\n  - From Figure 2 in the cleaned results, the percentage of \u201cNot Available\u201d analysis scripts for \u201cPre-RC (2008-09)\u201d.\n  - From Table 1 in the cleaned results, the number of \u201cIncluded Articles After.OS\u201d.\n- The final answer must be a Python dictionary with exactly these two keys:\n  - \"fig From Figure 2 in the cleaned results, report the percentage of 'Not Available' analysis scripts for Pre-RC (2008-09)\"\n  - \"fig From Table 1 in the cleaned results, report the number of Included Articles After.OS\"\n\n### 1.2. Facts to look up\n- Repository structure and location of files:\n  - Where master_script.R is located in the current directory tree.\n  - Where the Readme file is located and its exact installation instructions.\n  - Where the results directory is or whether it must be created if missing.\n  - Where the \u201ccleaned results\u201d are written by the scripts (e.g., within results/03_analyses or another subfolder).\n  - Tools:\n    - Use file_content_search to find master_script.R and README/Readme.md.\n    - Use inspect_file_as_text to read the README and any output files (CSV, PDF, XLSX).\n- Software requirements:\n  - R version requirements (if specified) and any system libraries needed (e.g., libcurl4-openssl-dev, libssl-dev, libxml2-dev, pandoc).\n  - R package dependencies and versions; whether the repo uses renv or packrat.\n  - Where to find: Readme, DESCRIPTION/NAMESPACE (if an R package structure), renv.lock (if present).\n- Execution details:\n  - Whether master_script.R assumes a specific working directory.\n  - Whether the script expects the results/01_scopus-selection, results/02_coding, and results/03_analyses directories to exist prior to execution.\n  - Whether the script requires any inputs (e.g., raw data files) and if they are included in the repo.\n  - Where to find: Readme, comments at the top of master_script.R.\n- Output artifacts containing the needed values:\n  - What files constitute the \u201ccleaned results\u201d (filenames such as cleaned_*.csv, figure2_*.csv, table1_*.csv/xlsx, or a PDF report).\n  - The exact file containing Figure 2\u2019s data; if it\u2019s a figure image or PDF, whether there is an accompanying data table used to generate it.\n  - The exact file containing Table 1; whether it\u2019s a CSV/XLSX or a PDF/HTML.\n  - Where to find: Search in results directory after running; look for keywords \u201cFigure 2\u201d, \u201cTable 1\u201d, \u201ccleaned\u201d, \u201canalysis scripts\u201d, \u201cNot Available\u201d, \u201cPre-RC (2008-09)\u201d, \u201cAfter.OS\u201d.\n- Data schema/labels:\n  - The exact label for the era \u201cPre-RC (2008-09)\u201d in the output files (case and punctuation sensitive).\n  - The exact label for \u201cNot Available\u201d category and its encoding in the data (e.g., \u201cNot available\u201d, \u201cNA\u201d, \u201cNot Available\u201d).\n  - The exact label \u201cAfter.OS\u201d in Table 1 and whether it appears as a column, row, or field value.\n  - Where to find: The cleaned results files.\n\n### 1.3. Facts to derive\n- From Figure 2 data:\n  - The percentage value of the \u201cNot Available\u201d category for the group \u201cPre-RC (2008-09)\u201d.\n  - If only counts are provided, compute the percentage: percentage = 100 * count_NotAvailable / total_for_group.\n  - If percentages are already provided, confirm the exact numeric value and rounding as presented in the figure or its source data.\n  - Validate that the \u201cNot Available\u201d category pertains to \u201canalysis scripts\u201d availability.\n- From Table 1 data:\n  - The numeric entry for \u201cIncluded Articles After.OS\u201d.\n  - If the value is not directly labeled, derive from rows/columns (e.g., sum of subcategories if Table 1 presents breakdowns).\n- Confirm that the extracted values exactly match what is reported in the cleaned results, ensuring no assumptions about capitalization, punctuation, or rounding. If rounding conventions are specified (e.g., 1 decimal place), match them.\n\n## 2. Plan\n1. Discover repository files:\n   - Use file_content_search to locate master_script.R and the Readme (README.md/Readme.md).\n   - If multiple candidates for master_script.R exist, open them to identify the correct driver script.\n2. Read Readme and scripts:\n   - Use inspect_file_as_text to read README and master_script.R header/comments for installation, dependencies, and expected directory structure.\n3. Install system dependencies:\n   - Use execute_bash to install any required system libraries (e.g., libcurl4-openssl-dev, libssl-dev, libxml2-dev, pandoc) as specified by README.\n4. Install R and R packages:\n   - Ensure R is available; if not, install via apt.\n   - If renv.lock exists, run Rscript -e 'install.packages(\"renv\"); renv::restore()'.\n   - Otherwise, install packages listed in README using Rscript -e 'install.packages(c(...))'.\n5. Create required results directories:\n   - Use execute_bash to create results/01_scopus-selection, results/02_coding, results/03_analyses (mkdir -p).\n6. Run the analysis:\n   - Execute Rscript master_script.R from the repository root.\n   - If the script expects a working directory, set it accordingly (e.g., run from repo root).\n7. Verify outputs:\n   - Use file_content_search to locate \u201ccleaned\u201d outputs and files related to Figure 2 and Table 1 within results/, especially in results/03_analyses.\n8. Extract Figure 2 data:\n   - Identify the source data file for Figure 2 (prefer CSV/XLSX/TSV). If only a PDF/image is present, open with inspect_file_as_text (for PDF) or query_vision_language_model (for images) to read the values.\n   - Locate the row/column for \u201cPre-RC (2008-09)\u201d and the \u201cNot Available\u201d category.\n   - Record the percentage as reported; if only counts are present, compute the percentage with python_interpreter, ensuring the same rounding as the figure.\n9. Extract Table 1 value:\n   - Open the Table 1 source (CSV/XLSX or PDF).\n   - Find the entry labeled \u201cIncluded Articles After.OS\u201d and record the number. If the table presents separate lines to be summed, compute with python_interpreter.\n10. Validate and format:\n   - Confirm extracted values align with the cleaned results\u2019 presentation (check rounding/format).\n   - Construct the Python dictionary with the exact keys provided and the extracted values.\n11. Return final answer:\n   - Use final_answer to output the dictionary.\n\n<end_plan>\n\n---\n\n1. Facts survey\n\n### 1.1. Facts given in the task\n1. The repository containing the code from a scientific paper is already cloned in the current directory.  \n   Reasoning: The task statement begins \u201cthe repository cloned to your current directory\u2026\u201d.\n2. We must create three specific subdirectories under `results/`:  \n   - `01_scopus-selection`  \n   - `02_coding`  \n   - `03_analyses`  \n   Reasoning: The task explicitly instructs these three directories be created in `results/`.\n3.

Extract Figure 2 data:\n   - Identify the source data file for Figure 2 (prefer CSV/XLSX/TSV). If only a PDF/image is present, open with inspect_file_as_text (for PDF) or query_vision_language_model (for images) to read the values.\n   - Locate the row/column for \u201cPre-RC (2008-09)\u201d and the \u201cNot Available\u201d category.\n   - Record the percentage as reported; if only counts are present, compute the percentage with python_interpreter, ensuring the same rounding as the figure.\n9. Extract Table 1 value:\n   - Open the Table 1 source (CSV/XLSX or PDF).\n   - Find the entry labeled \u201cIncluded Articles After.OS\u201d and record the number.

Run the analysis:\n   - Execute Rscript master_script.R from the repository root.\n   - If the script expects a working directory, set it accordingly (e.g., run from repo root).\n7. Verify outputs:\n   - Use file_content_search to locate \u201ccleaned\u201d outputs and files related to Figure 2 and Table 1 within results/, especially in results/03_analyses.\n8. Extract Figure 2 data:\n   - Identify the source data file for Figure 2 (prefer CSV/XLSX/TSV). If only a PDF/image is present, open with inspect_file_as_text (for PDF) or query_vision_language_model (for images) to read the values.\n   - Locate the row/column for \u201cPre-RC (2008-09)\u201d and the \u201cNot Available\u201d category.\n   - Record the percentage as reported; if only counts are present, compute the percentage with python_interpreter, ensuring the same rounding as the figure.\n9. Extract Table 1 value:\n   - Open the Table 1 source (CSV/XLSX or PDF).\n   - Find the entry labeled \u201cIncluded Articles After.OS\u201d and record the number.

        "1. Facts survey\n\n### 1.1. Facts given in the task\n1. The repository containing the code from a scientific paper is already cloned in the current directory.  \n   Reasoning: The task statement begins \u201cthe repository cloned to your current directory\u2026\u201d.\n2. We must create three specific subdirectories under `results/`:  \n   - `01_scopus-selection`  \n   - `02_coding`  \n   - `03_analyses`  \n   Reasoning: The task explicitly instructs these three directories be created in `results/`.\n3. All R dependencies listed in the project\u2019s README must be installed.  \n   Reasoning: \u201cYou should install all of the requirements found in the Readme file\u2026\u201d\n4. The main analysis script is `master_script.R`, which must be run with `Rscript`.  \n   Reasoning: The task says \u201cRun 'master_script.R' using Rscript.\u201d\n5. After running the script, the \u201ccleaned results\u201d will contain outputs from which we must extract two numbers:  \n   - From \u201cFigure 2 in the cleaned results\u201d: the percentage of \u201cNot Available\u201d analysis scripts for Pre-RC (2008-09).  \n   - From \u201cTable 1 in the cleaned results\u201d: the number of \u201cIncluded Articles After.OS.\u201d  \n   Reasoning: These exact two questions define the outputs we seek.\n6. The final output must be a Python dictionary with exactly those two questions as keys and their computed answers as values.  \n   Reasoning: \u201cYour submitted answer should be a Python dictionary whose keys are exactly those questions and values are the answers.\u201d\n\n### 1.2. Facts to look up\n1. Location and content of the project README (to learn how to install requirements and any environment setup).  \n   Where: use `file_content_search` to find filenames matching `README*` and `inspect_file_as_text` to read it.\n2. List of required R packages (and any version pins) as specified in the README or any lock file (e.g., `DESCRIPTION`, `renv.lock`).  \n   Where: the README itself or any `renv.lock`/`environment.yml` in the repo.\n3. Location (path) of `master_script.R` in the repository.  \n   Where: `file_content_search(query=\"master_script.R\", exclude_pattern=\"\")`.\n4. Any configuration or environment files that tell `master_script.R` where to write the cleaned outputs (e.g., a parameters file, config.R, or hard-coded paths inside `master_script.R`).  \n   Where: inspect `master_script.R` via `inspect_file_as_text`.\n5. The directory where \u201ccleaned results\u201d end up (e.g., `results/cleaned`, `results/03_analyses/cleaned`).  \n   Where: read code in `master_script.R`.\n6. Exact filenames (and formats: CSV, RDS, XLSX) for the cleaned outputs corresponding to Figure 2 and Table 1.  \n   Where: once output directory is known, use `execute_bash(\"ls <that_dir>\")` or `file_content_search` for \u201cfigure2\u201d and \u201ctable1\u201d.\n\n### 1.3. Facts to derive\n1. From the cleaned\u2010Figure 2 data file:  \n   \u2013 Filter rows where time period == \u201cPre-RC (2008-09)\u201d.  \n   \u2013 Count how many have `analysis_script_status == \"Not Available\"`.  \n   \u2013 Divide by total rows for \u201cPre-RC (2008-09)\u201d and multiply by 100 to get the percentage.  \n   Reasoning: The question asks for the \u201cpercentage of 'Not Available' analysis scripts for Pre-RC (2008-09).\u201d\n2. From the cleaned\u2010Table 1 data file:  \n   \u2013 Locate the cell or row labelled \u201cIncluded Articles After.OS\u201d.  \n   \u2013 Extract its numeric value.  \n   Reasoning: The question asks for the number of \u201cIncluded Articles After.OS.\u201d\n\n2. Plan\n\n1. Locate and read the project README to identify and install all R/package dependencies.  \n2. Create the directories `results/01_scopus-selection`, `results/02_coding`, and `results/03_analyses`.  \n3. Locate `master_script.R` and any configuration it uses to determine output paths.  \n4. Run `Rscript master_script.R` in the project root to generate all cleaned results.  \n5. Identify the cleaned\u2010results output directory and list its contents to find the exact filenames for Figure 2 and Table 1.  \n6. Load the cleaned data for Figure 2 into Python (via `python_interpreter`), filter to Pre-RC (2008-09), compute the percentage of \u201cNot Available\u201d analysis scripts.  \n7. Load the cleaned data for Table 1 into Python, extract the number for \u201cIncluded Articles After.OS.\u201d  \n8.

Data format inside those output files:  \n   - How percentages are encoded (e.g., as numeric in CSV, or embedded in plot).  \n   - How Table 1 rows and columns are labeled.  \n   - Source: Opening the output files or code that writes them.\n\n### 1.3. Facts to derive  \n1. The percentage of \u201cNot Available\u201d analysis scripts for Pre-RC (2008\u201309) from Figure 2.  \n   - This may require reading a CSV of summary statistics or parsing the plotted data.  \n2. The count corresponding to \u201cIncluded Articles After.OS\u201d from Table 1.  \n   - Requires reading Table 1 data structure and extracting that cell.  \n\n2. Plan\n\n1. Inspect the repository root to locate the README file.  \n2. Read the README to identify installation instructions and list of required packages or dependencies.  \n3. Install required system tools and R packages (e.g., via `apt`, `pip`, or `Rscript -e 'install.packages(...)'`).  \n4. Ensure R and Rscript are installed and available.  \n5. In the project directory, create the `results` folder if it does not exist.  \n6. Under `results`, create subdirectories:  \n   - `01_scopus-selection`  \n   - `02_coding`  \n   - `03_analyses`  \n7.

Facts to look up\n- Repository structure and location of files:\n  - Where master_script.R is located in the current directory tree.\n  - Where the Readme file is located and its exact installation instructions.\n  - Where the results directory is or whether it must be created if missing.\n  - Where the \u201ccleaned results\u201d are written by the scripts (e.g., within results/03_analyses or another subfolder).\n  - Tools:\n    - Use file_content_search to find master_script.R and README/Readme.md.\n    - Use inspect_file_as_text to read the README and any output files (CSV, PDF, XLSX).\n- Software requirements:\n  - R version requirements (if specified) and any system libraries needed (e.g., libcurl4-openssl-dev, libssl-dev, libxml2-dev, pandoc).\n  - R package dependencies and versions; whether the repo uses renv or packrat.\n  - Where to find: Readme, DESCRIPTION/NAMESPACE (if an R package structure), renv.lock (if present).\n- Execution details:\n  - Whether master_script.R assumes a specific working directory.\n  - Whether the script expects the results/01_scopus-selection, results/02_coding, and results/03_analyses directories to exist prior to execution.\n  - Whether the script requires any inputs (e.g., raw data files) and if they are included in the repo.\n  - Where to find: Readme, comments at the top of master_script.R.\n- Output artifacts containing the needed values:\n  - What files constitute the \u201ccleaned results\u201d (filenames such as cleaned_*.csv, figure2_*.csv, table1_*.csv/xlsx, or a PDF report).\n  - The exact file containing Figure 2\u2019s data; if it\u2019s a figure image or PDF, whether there is an accompanying data table used to generate it.\n  - The exact file containing Table 1; whether it\u2019s a CSV/XLSX or a PDF/HTML.\n  - Where to find: Search in results directory after running; look for keywords \u201cFigure 2\u201d, \u201cTable 1\u201d, \u201ccleaned\u201d, \u201canalysis scripts\u201d, \u201cNot Available\u201d, \u201cPre-RC (2008-09)\u201d, \u201cAfter.OS\u201d.\n- Data schema/labels:\n  - The exact label for the era \u201cPre-RC (2008-09)\u201d in the output files (case and punctuation sensitive).\n  - The exact label for \u201cNot Available\u201d category and its encoding in the data (e.g., \u201cNot available\u201d, \u201cNA\u201d, \u201cNot Available\u201d).\n  - The exact label \u201cAfter.OS\u201d in Table 1 and whether it appears as a column, row, or field value.\n  - Where to find: The cleaned results files.\n\n### 1.3. Facts to derive\n- From Figure 2 data:\n  - The percentage value of the \u201cNot Available\u201d category for the group \u201cPre-RC (2008-09)\u201d.\n  - If only counts are provided, compute the percentage: percentage = 100 * count_NotAvailable / total_for_group.\n  - If percentages are already provided, confirm the exact numeric value and rounding as presented in the figure or its source data.\n  - Validate that the \u201cNot Available\u201d category pertains to \u201canalysis scripts\u201d availability.\n- From Table 1 data:\n  - The numeric entry for \u201cIncluded Articles After.OS\u201d.\n  - If the value is not directly labeled, derive from rows/columns (e.g., sum of subcategories if Table 1 presents breakdowns).\n- Confirm that the extracted values exactly match what is reported in the cleaned results, ensuring no assumptions about capitalization, punctuation, or rounding. If rounding conventions are specified (e.g., 1 decimal place), match them.\n\n## 2. Plan\n1. Discover repository files:\n   - Use file_content_search to locate master_script.R and the Readme (README.md/Readme.md).\n   - If multiple candidates for master_script.R exist, open them to identify the correct driver script.\n2. Read Readme and scripts:\n   - Use inspect_file_as_text to read README and master_script.R header/comments for installation, dependencies, and expected directory structure.\n3. Install system dependencies:\n   - Use execute_bash to install any required system libraries (e.g., libcurl4-openssl-dev, libssl-dev, libxml2-dev, pandoc) as specified by README.\n4. Install R and R packages:\n   - Ensure R is available; if not, install via apt.\n   - If renv.lock exists, run Rscript -e 'install.packages(\"renv\"); renv::restore()'.\n   - Otherwise, install packages listed in README using Rscript -e 'install.packages(c(...))'.\n5. Create required results directories:\n   - Use execute_bash to create results/01_scopus-selection, results/02_coding, results/03_analyses (mkdir -p).\n6. Run the analysis:\n   - Execute Rscript master_script.R from the repository root.\n   - If the script expects a working directory, set it accordingly (e.g., run from repo root).\n7. Verify outputs:\n   - Use file_content_search to locate \u201ccleaned\u201d outputs and files related to Figure 2 and Table 1 within results/, especially in results/03_analyses.\n8. Extract Figure 2 data:\n   - Identify the source data file for Figure 2 (prefer CSV/XLSX/TSV). If only a PDF/image is present, open with inspect_file_as_text (for PDF) or query_vision_language_model (for images) to read the values.\n   - Locate the row/column for \u201cPre-RC (2008-09)\u201d and the \u201cNot Available\u201d category.\n   - Record the percentage as reported; if only counts are present, compute the percentage with python_interpreter, ensuring the same rounding as the figure.\n9. Extract Table 1 value:\n   - Open the Table 1 source (CSV/XLSX or PDF).\n   - Find the entry labeled \u201cIncluded Articles After.OS\u201d and record the number. If the table presents separate lines to be summed, compute with python_interpreter.\n10. Validate and format:\n   - Confirm extracted values align with the cleaned results\u2019 presentation (check rounding/format).\n   - Construct the Python dictionary with the exact keys provided and the extracted values.\n11. Return final answer:\n   - Use final_answer to output the dictionary.\n\n<end_plan>",
        "1. Facts survey\n\n### 1.1. Facts given in the task\n1. The repository containing the code from a scientific paper is already cloned in the current directory.  \n   Reasoning: The task statement begins \u201cthe repository cloned to your current directory\u2026\u201d.\n2. We must create three specific subdirectories under `results/`:  \n   - `01_scopus-selection`  \n   - `02_coding`  \n   - `03_analyses`  \n   Reasoning: The task explicitly instructs these three directories be created in `results/`.\n3. All R dependencies listed in the project\u2019s README must be installed.  \n   Reasoning: \u201cYou should install all of the requirements found in the Readme file\u2026\u201d\n4. The main analysis script is `master_script.R`, which must be run with `Rscript`.  \n   Reasoning: The task says \u201cRun 'master_script.R' using Rscript.\u201d\n5. After running the script, the \u201ccleaned results\u201d will contain outputs from which we must extract two numbers:  \n   - From \u201cFigure 2 in the cleaned results\u201d: the percentage of \u201cNot Available\u201d analysis scripts for Pre-RC (2008-09).  \n   - From \u201cTable 1 in the cleaned results\u201d: the number of \u201cIncluded Articles After.OS.\u201d  \n   Reasoning: These exact two questions define the outputs we seek.\n6. The final output must be a Python dictionary with exactly those two questions as keys and their computed answers as values.  \n   Reasoning: \u201cYour submitted answer should be a Python dictionary whose keys are exactly those questions and values are the answers.\u201d\n\n### 1.2. Facts to look up\n1. Location and content of the project README (to learn how to install requirements and any environment setup).  \n   Where: use `file_content_search` to find filenames matching `README*` and `inspect_file_as_text` to read it.\n2. List of required R packages (and any version pins) as specified in the README or any lock file (e.g., `DESCRIPTION`, `renv.lock`).  \n   Where: the README itself or any `renv.lock`/`environment.yml` in the repo.\n3. Location (path) of `master_script.R` in the repository.  \n   Where: `file_content_search(query=\"master_script.R\", exclude_pattern=\"\")`.\n4. Any configuration or environment files that tell `master_script.R` where to write the cleaned outputs (e.g., a parameters file, config.R, or hard-coded paths inside `master_script.R`).  \n   Where: inspect `master_script.R` via `inspect_file_as_text`.\n5. The directory where \u201ccleaned results\u201d end up (e.g., `results/cleaned`, `results/03_analyses/cleaned`).  \n   Where: read code in `master_script.R`.\n6. Exact filenames (and formats: CSV, RDS, XLSX) for the cleaned outputs corresponding to Figure 2 and Table 1.  \n   Where: once output directory is known, use `execute_bash(\"ls <that_dir>\")` or `file_content_search` for \u201cfigure2\u201d and \u201ctable1\u201d.\n\n### 1.3. Facts to derive\n1. From the cleaned\u2010Figure 2 data file:  \n   \u2013 Filter rows where time period == \u201cPre-RC (2008-09)\u201d.  \n   \u2013 Count how many have `analysis_script_status == \"Not Available\"`.  \n   \u2013 Divide by total rows for \u201cPre-RC (2008-09)\u201d and multiply by 100 to get the percentage.  \n   Reasoning: The question asks for the \u201cpercentage of 'Not Available' analysis scripts for Pre-RC (2008-09).\u201d\n2. From the cleaned\u2010Table 1 data file:  \n   \u2013 Locate the cell or row labelled \u201cIncluded Articles After.OS\u201d.  \n   \u2013 Extract its numeric value.  \n   Reasoning: The question asks for the number of \u201cIncluded Articles After.OS.\u201d\n\n2. Plan\n\n1. Locate and read the project README to identify and install all R/package dependencies.  \n2. Create the directories `results/01_scopus-selection`, `results/02_coding`, and `results/03_analyses`.  \n3. Locate `master_script.R` and any configuration it uses to determine output paths.  \n4. Run `Rscript master_script.R` in the project root to generate all cleaned results.  \n5. Identify the cleaned\u2010results output directory and list its contents to find the exact filenames for Figure 2 and Table 1.  \n6. Load the cleaned data for Figure 2 into Python (via `python_interpreter`), filter to Pre-RC (2008-09), compute the percentage of \u201cNot Available\u201d analysis scripts.  \n7. Load the cleaned data for Table 1 into Python, extract the number for \u201cIncluded Articles After.OS.\u201d  \n8. Construct a Python dictionary with the two question strings as keys and the corresponding computed values as values.  \n9. Return this dictionary via `final_answer`.  \n<end_plan>",
        "1. Facts survey\n\n### 1.1. Facts given in the task  \n1. The repository contains code from a scientific paper.  \n2. There is a master R script named `master_script.R`.  \n3. We must install all requirements listed in the repository\u2019s Readme.  \n4. We need to create three directories under `results/`:  \n   - `01_scopus-selection`  \n   - `02_coding`  \n   - `03_analyses`  \n5. After running `master_script.R` via `Rscript`, the cleaned results folder will contain:  \n   - a Figure 2, from which we must report the percentage of \u201cNot Available\u201d analysis scripts for Pre-RC (2008\u201309).  \n   - a Table 1, from which we must report the number of \u201cIncluded Articles After.OS\u201d.  \n6. The final output must be a Python dictionary with exactly two keys:  \n   - `\"fig From Figure 2 in the cleaned results, report the percentage of 'Not Available' analysis scripts for Pre-RC (2008-09)\"`  \n   - `\"fig From Table 1 in the cleaned results, report the number of Included Articles After.OS\"`\n\n### 1.2. Facts to look up  \n1. Exact location and names of requirements in the Readme (e.g., `requirements.txt`, R packages).  \n   - Source: The repository\u2019s README file.  \n2. File paths under `results/cleaned` (or whatever the script outputs) for:  \n   - Figure 2 data or image.  \n   - Table 1 data (likely CSV, XLSX, or similar).  \n   - Source: Directory listing after running the script.  \n3. Data format inside those output files:  \n   - How percentages are encoded (e.g., as numeric in CSV, or embedded in plot).  \n   - How Table 1 rows and columns are labeled.  \n   - Source: Opening the output files or code that writes them.\n\n### 1.3. Facts to derive  \n1. The percentage of \u201cNot Available\u201d analysis scripts for Pre-RC (2008\u201309) from Figure 2.  \n   - This may require reading a CSV of summary statistics or parsing the plotted data.  \n2. The count corresponding to \u201cIncluded Articles After.OS\u201d from Table 1.  \n   - Requires reading Table 1 data structure and extracting that cell.  \n\n2. Plan\n\n1. Inspect the repository root to locate the README file.  \n2. Read the README to identify installation instructions and list of required packages or dependencies.  \n3. Install required system tools and R packages (e.g., via `apt`, `pip`, or `Rscript -e 'install.packages(...)'`).  \n4. Ensure R and Rscript are installed and available.  \n5. In the project directory, create the `results` folder if it does not exist.  \n6. Under `results`, create subdirectories:  \n   - `01_scopus-selection`  \n   - `02_coding`  \n   - `03_analyses`  \n7. Run the master script with:  \n   - `Rscript master_script.R`  \n   - Confirm it completes without error.  \n8. After execution, list the contents of the cleaned results directory to locate:  \n   - Figure 2 output (e.g., `figure2.csv` or an image).  \n   - Table 1 output (e.g., `table1.csv` or similar).  \n9. Load the Figure 2 data file into Python or R to extract the percentage of \u201cNot Available\u201d analysis scripts for the Pre-RC period (2008\u201309).  \n10. Load the Table 1 data file into Python or R to extract the value in the cell labeled \u201cIncluded Articles After.OS.\u201d  \n11. Construct a Python dictionary with the two questions as keys and the extracted values as answers.  \n12. Return this dictionary as the final result.  \n<end_plan>"
