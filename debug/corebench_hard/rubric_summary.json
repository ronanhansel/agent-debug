Facts given in the task\n\n- The task involves a code repository cloned into the current directory associated with a scientific paper.\n- R scripts to be run: '01_motivation.R', '02_design.R', '03_survey.R', '04_metaketa_comp.R', '05_lapop.R', '06_misc.R', using Rscript.\n- The goal is to test computational reproducibility and answer two specific questions:\n    - \"From the figure measuring homicide rate per 100k in the last 12 months, report the name of the sample with the lower homicide rate per 100k in 2000.\"\n    - \"From the figure measuring bootstrapped predictive distribution of endline trust in police assuming mean regression at rate of mean regression among unexposed citizens, report the p value from the Heard of Meetings plot.\"\n- All requirements are to be installed as specified in the Readme file.\n- The answer should be a Python dictionary with exactly those two question keys, values being their corresponding answers.\n\n### 1.2. Facts to look up\n\n- Presence and content of a Readme file: It should state the requirements for running the R scripts (e.g., R packages).\n    - Location: ./README, ./README.md, or similar in the repository.\n- Output (figures, logs, tables, etc.) generated by each R script, especially:\n    - Where are the plots or figures from which the answers can be derived? (e.g., PDF, PNG, in a 'figures' or 'output' folder, or as R-generated windows)\n    - Does each script print results to the terminal, write to a file, or produce figures?\n- The actual output content/figures after running:\n    - The figure measuring homicide rate per 100k in the last 12 months (for 2000, by sample).\n    - The figure for the bootstrapped predictive distribution of endline trust in police, especially focusing on the Heard of Meetings plot and its p-value.\n    - Any legend, axis, annotations for figures to identify the correct sample names and p-values.\n- Whether required R packages (from Readme) are already installed or if installation is needed.\n- Exact script file names and existence in the directory.\n\n### 1.3. Facts to derive\n\n- The correct R and system commands needed to:\n    - Install requirements as per the Readme.\n    - Run each R script, ensuring errors and package dependencies are resolved.\n- Which script produces which figure, given the likely mapping between figure content/title and script name/content.\n- From the output figures, derive:\n    - For the homicide rate figure: which sample has the lowest homicide rate per 100k in 2000 (by comparing y-axis values for 2000).\n    - For the trust in police predictive distribution: identification of the Heard of Meetings plot and extracting the p-value from it (text or visual annotation).\n- If necessary, the code or figure structure/format for extracting numerical or nominal values (i.e., sample names, p-values).\n- Final construction of a Python dictionary answer with these extracted values.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Plan\n\n1. Check for the presence of the Readme file in the project directory and read its content to determine R package dependencies and setup instructions.\n2. Install any required R packages as listed in the Readme, confirming installation was successful.\n3. Verify that all the specified R scripts ('01_motivation.R', '02_design.R', '03_survey.R', '04_metaketa_comp.R', '05_lapop.R', '06_misc.R') are present in the directory.\n4. Run each R script sequentially using Rscript, capturing any terminal output and noting any generated output files (figures, tables, logs, etc.).\n5. For each R script, investigate the nature and location of their outputs to identify:\n    a. The output figure that measures homicide rate per 100k in the last 12 months (ensure it contains data for 2000).\n    b. The figure showing the bootstrapped predictive distribution of endline trust in police for \"Heard of Meetings\" plot with its p-value.\n6. Locate and inspect the identified output figures/files:\n    a. For the homicide rate figure: Examine the plotted data for 2000, identify and record the name of the sample with the lowest homicide rate per 100k.\n    b. For the trust in police plot: Extract the reported p-value from the Heard of Meetings plot.\n7. Compile the extracted values into a Python dictionary with keys exactly matching the task questions, mapping to the corresponding answers.\n8. Submit the final answer as the Python dictionary.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Facts survey\n\n### 1.1. Facts given in the task  \n1. The repository (already cloned in the current working directory) contains code associated with a scientific paper.  \n2. Six R scripts must be run, in order, via `Rscript`:  \n   \u2022 `01_motivation.R`  \n   \u2022 `02_design.R`  \n   \u2022 `03_survey.R`  \n   \u2022 `04_metaketa_comp.R`  \n   \u2022 `05_lapop.R`  \n   \u2022 `06_misc.R`  \n3. Two figure\u2013based questions have to be answered and returned as a Python dictionary with the exact keys supplied:  \n   \u2022 \u201cfig From the figure measuring homicide rate per 100k in the last 12 months, report the name of the sample with the lower homicide rate per 100k in 2000.\u201d  \n   \u2022 \u201cfig From the figure measuring bootstrapped predictive distribution of endline trust in police assuming mean regression at rate of mean regression among unexposed citizens, report the p value from the Heard of Meetings plot.\u201d  \n4. We must install all requirements listed in the repository\u2019s README before running the scripts.  \n5. The final deliverable is a Python dictionary whose keys are exactly the two questions and whose values are the extracted answers.\n\n### 1.2. Facts to look up  \nWe still need explicit, objective values to answer the questions.  \n1. Exact location of the repository\u2019s README file to obtain the list of software/R-package requirements.  \n   \u2022 Source: `README.md` in the repo root.  \n2. Any additional R package dependencies implicitly installed inside the R scripts themselves (might require parsing the scripts for `library(...)` calls).  \n   \u2022 Source: each `01_*.R`-`06_*.R` file.  \n3. Where the R scripts save or display the relevant figures (file names, folders, or on-screen plotting only).  \n   \u2022 Source: same R scripts or their helper functions.  \n4. If the figures are saved to disk, the file formats and paths so we can open them programmatically and read off the needed numbers.  \n   \u2022 Source: R code that creates the plots.  \n5. If the figures are not saved, how to reproduce or extract numeric results underlying them (e.g., objects in the R environment that contain those statistics).  \n   \u2022 Source: the R scripts or RData files they generate.  \n6. Exact numeric answer for:  \n   \u2022 The sample with the lower homicide\u2010rate-per-100k in 2000 (so we need the figure\u2019s plotted values or the underlying dataframe).  \n   \u2022 The p-value reported on the \u201cHeard of Meetings\u201d bootstrapped predictive distribution plot.  \n   \u2022 Source: results produced by running the scripts; possibly printed to console, written to CSV/RDS, or embedded in ggplot annotations.  \n\n### 1.3. Facts to derive  \nThese will be computed or inferred after the scripts run.  \n1. After generating (or reading) the homicide\u2010rate figure data for year 2000, compare the values for the two (or more) plotted samples to decide which one is lower.  \n   \u2022 Logic: subset the dataframe to year == 2000, then compare rates per sample.  \n2. Extract the p-value corresponding to \u201cHeard of Meetings\u201d from whatever object or annotation the script produces (likely stored in a tidy dataframe used for the plot).  \n   \u2022 Logic: find column matching \u201cp.value\u201d or similar, filter by variable == \"Heard of Meetings\".  \n3. Assemble a Python dictionary exactly matching the two provided question strings as keys and the derived answers as values.  \n\n## 2. Plan\n1. Open the repo README (`inspect_file_as_text`) to list required R packages or system libraries.  \n2. Install missing system libraries via apt (if any) and R packages via an R one-liner using `install.packages()` or `remotes::install_github()` as indicated.  \n3. Parse the six R scripts for additional `library(...)` calls and install any packages not listed in the README.  \n4. Execute each script in the prescribed order with `execute_bash(\"Rscript 01_motivation.R\")`, etc., capturing stdout/stderr to detect errors.  \n5. While running, note any files created (e.g., `.csv`, `.rds`, `.RData`, `.pdf`, `.png`). Search for figure files or data output folders.  \n6. Use `file_content_search` or `inspect_file_as_text` to locate the homicide-rate data (e.g., look for filenames or objects like \u201chomicide\u201d or \u201crate_per_100k\u201d).  \n   a. If a data file is produced (CSV/RDS), load it in Python via `python_interpreter` (or potentially rerun an R snippet) to identify 2000 rates and the corresponding sample names.  \n   b. If only a plot file exists, open it (if text-based like PDF) to parse labels; otherwise, review the script generating the plot to find the underlying dataframe and repeat step 6a.  \n7. Identify the lower homicide rate sample for the year 2000 and store its exact name as a string.  \n8. Locate the object or dataframe feeding the \u201cbootstrapped predictive distribution\u201d plot in script `06_misc.R` (or earlier). Extract the p-value linked to the variable \u201cHeard of Meetings\u201d.  \n9. Store that numeric p-value.  \n10. Build a Python dictionary:  \n    ```\n    answers = {\n        \"fig From the figure measuring homicide rate per 100k in the last 12 months, report the name of the sample with the lower homicide rate per 100k in 2000.\": <sample_name>,\n        \"fig From the figure measuring bootstrapped predictive distribution of endline trust in police assuming mean regression at rate of mean regression among unexposed citizens, report the p value from the Heard of Meetings plot.\": <p_value>\n    }\n    ```  \n11. Return the dictionary via `final_answer(answers)`.  \n<end_plan>\n\n---\n\n## 1. Facts survey\n\n### 1.1.

Facts to look up\n\n- Presence and content of a Readme file: It should state the requirements for running the R scripts (e.g., R packages).\n    - Location: ./README, ./README.md, or similar in the repository.\n- Output (figures, logs, tables, etc.) generated by each R script, especially:\n    - Where are the plots or figures from which the answers can be derived? (e.g., PDF, PNG, in a 'figures' or 'output' folder, or as R-generated windows)\n    - Does each script print results to the terminal, write to a file, or produce figures?\n- The actual output content/figures after running:\n    - The figure measuring homicide rate per 100k in the last 12 months (for 2000, by sample).\n    - The figure for the bootstrapped predictive distribution of endline trust in police, especially focusing on the Heard of Meetings plot and its p-value.\n    - Any legend, axis, annotations for figures to identify the correct sample names and p-values.\n- Whether required R packages (from Readme) are already installed or if installation is needed.\n- Exact script file names and existence in the directory.\n\n### 1.3.

Verify that all the specified R scripts ('01_motivation.R', '02_design.R', '03_survey.R', '04_metaketa_comp.R', '05_lapop.R', '06_misc.R') are present in the directory.\n4. Run each R script sequentially using Rscript, capturing any terminal output and noting any generated output files (figures, tables, logs, etc.).\n5. For each R script, investigate the nature and location of their outputs to identify:\n    a. The output figure that measures homicide rate per 100k in the last 12 months (ensure it contains data for 2000).\n    b. The figure showing the bootstrapped predictive distribution of endline trust in police for \"Heard of Meetings\" plot with its p-value.\n6.

        "## 1. Facts survey\n\n### 1.1. Facts given in the task  \n1. The repository (already cloned in the current working directory) contains code associated with a scientific paper.  \n2. Six R scripts must be run, in order, via `Rscript`:  \n   \u2022 `01_motivation.R`  \n   \u2022 `02_design.R`  \n   \u2022 `03_survey.R`  \n   \u2022 `04_metaketa_comp.R`  \n   \u2022 `05_lapop.R`  \n   \u2022 `06_misc.R`  \n3. Two figure\u2013based questions have to be answered and returned as a Python dictionary with the exact keys supplied:  \n   \u2022 \u201cfig From the figure measuring homicide rate per 100k in the last 12 months, report the name of the sample with the lower homicide rate per 100k in 2000.\u201d  \n   \u2022 \u201cfig From the figure measuring bootstrapped predictive distribution of endline trust in police assuming mean regression at rate of mean regression among unexposed citizens, report the p value from the Heard of Meetings plot.\u201d  \n4. We must install all requirements listed in the repository\u2019s README before running the scripts.  \n5. The final deliverable is a Python dictionary whose keys are exactly the two questions and whose values are the extracted answers.\n\n### 1.2. Facts to look up  \nWe still need explicit, objective values to answer the questions.  \n1. Exact location of the repository\u2019s README file to obtain the list of software/R-package requirements.  \n   \u2022 Source: `README.md` in the repo root.  \n2. Any additional R package dependencies implicitly installed inside the R scripts themselves (might require parsing the scripts for `library(...)` calls).  \n   \u2022 Source: each `01_*.R`-`06_*.R` file.  \n3. Where the R scripts save or display the relevant figures (file names, folders, or on-screen plotting only).  \n   \u2022 Source: same R scripts or their helper functions.  \n4. If the figures are saved to disk, the file formats and paths so we can open them programmatically and read off the needed numbers.  \n   \u2022 Source: R code that creates the plots.  \n5. If the figures are not saved, how to reproduce or extract numeric results underlying them (e.g., objects in the R environment that contain those statistics).  \n   \u2022 Source: the R scripts or RData files they generate.  \n6. Exact numeric answer for:  \n   \u2022 The sample with the lower homicide\u2010rate-per-100k in 2000 (so we need the figure\u2019s plotted values or the underlying dataframe).  \n   \u2022 The p-value reported on the \u201cHeard of Meetings\u201d bootstrapped predictive distribution plot.  \n   \u2022 Source: results produced by running the scripts; possibly printed to console, written to CSV/RDS, or embedded in ggplot annotations.  \n\n### 1.3. Facts to derive  \nThese will be computed or inferred after the scripts run.  \n1. After generating (or reading) the homicide\u2010rate figure data for year 2000, compare the values for the two (or more) plotted samples to decide which one is lower.  \n   \u2022 Logic: subset the dataframe to year == 2000, then compare rates per sample.  \n2. Extract the p-value corresponding to \u201cHeard of Meetings\u201d from whatever object or annotation the script produces (likely stored in a tidy dataframe used for the plot).  \n   \u2022 Logic: find column matching \u201cp.value\u201d or similar, filter by variable == \"Heard of Meetings\".  \n3. Assemble a Python dictionary exactly matching the two provided question strings as keys and the derived answers as values.  \n\n## 2. Plan\n1. Open the repo README (`inspect_file_as_text`) to list required R packages or system libraries.  \n2. Install missing system libraries via apt (if any) and R packages via an R one-liner using `install.packages()` or `remotes::install_github()` as indicated.  \n3. Parse the six R scripts for additional `library(...)` calls and install any packages not listed in the README.  \n4. Execute each script in the prescribed order with `execute_bash(\"Rscript 01_motivation.R\")`, etc., capturing stdout/stderr to detect errors.  \n5. While running, note any files created (e.g., `.csv`, `.rds`, `.RData`, `.pdf`, `.png`). Search for figure files or data output folders.  \n6. Use `file_content_search` or `inspect_file_as_text` to locate the homicide-rate data (e.g., look for filenames or objects like \u201chomicide\u201d or \u201crate_per_100k\u201d).  \n   a. If a data file is produced (CSV/RDS), load it in Python via `python_interpreter` (or potentially rerun an R snippet) to identify 2000 rates and the corresponding sample names.  \n   b. If only a plot file exists, open it (if text-based like PDF) to parse labels; otherwise, review the script generating the plot to find the underlying dataframe and repeat step 6a.  \n7. Identify the lower homicide rate sample for the year 2000 and store its exact name as a string.  \n8. Locate the object or dataframe feeding the \u201cbootstrapped predictive distribution\u201d plot in script `06_misc.R` (or earlier). Extract the p-value linked to the variable \u201cHeard of Meetings\u201d.  \n9. Store that numeric p-value.  \n10. Build a Python dictionary:  \n    ```\n    answers = {\n        \"fig From the figure measuring homicide rate per 100k in the last 12 months, report the name of the sample with the lower homicide rate per 100k in 2000.\": <sample_name>,\n        \"fig From the figure measuring bootstrapped predictive distribution of endline trust in police assuming mean regression at rate of mean regression among unexposed citizens, report the p value from the Heard of Meetings plot.\": <p_value>\n    }\n    ```  \n11.
