  "rationale": "Evidence from the rubric shows that the run cannot execute 'run.sh' (it is missing from the file listing) and fails due to sandbox restrictions (errors indicating disallowed 'csv' and 'open' usages). This indicates an environmental barrier rather than a coding mistake in the agent's logic.",
