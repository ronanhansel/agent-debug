  "analysis": "The run failed due to an uncontrollable environmental barrier: the workspace is missing the preregSR_manuscript.Rmd file and the R package installation step (for example, loading 'meta') is blocked by non-interactive conda ToS restrictions.",
  "rationale": "The evidence shows two critical issues: first, error messages state that 'preregSR_manuscript.Rmd not found in workspace', and second, conda fails to install R dependencies because the core Anaconda channels require acceptance of Terms of Service. This indicates that the failure comes from the evaluation environment, not the agent\u2019s logic.",
