Initially, epidemic.py crashed with a ModuleNotFoundError for networkx, and even after installing networkx the network_diffusion package provided did not include the required MultiSpreading class needed by the code.",
  "rationale": "Evidence shows that the traceback first reported a missing networkx module (ModuleNotFoundError) [T0B25] and then, upon installation, an ImportError occurred when attempting to import MultiSpreading from network_diffusion [T0B52, T0B97, T0B57]. This indicates that not only was a dependency missing but the available version of network_diffusion is not the correct upstream version needed by epidemic.py.",
