  "analysis": "The run failed due to multiple environmental barriers: a disallowed import of the os module in the sandbox, a Python version and dependency mismatch (Python 3.12 vs required Python 3.8 and torch==1.7.1 not available), and a missing pretrained checkpoint file.",
  "rationale": "Evidence shows that the import 'os' is blocked (T0B7), pip cannot find torch==1.7.1 in Python 3.12 (T0B72), and a FileNotFoundError occurs for './data/cache/variable/bert/resume' (T0B451). These issues indicate that the mechanical run is blocked by evaluation environment constraints rather than by a defect in the agent\u2019s logic.",

Update the repository\u2019s dependency configuration by modifying requirements.txt or adding a prompt/input override in input_override.json to install a torch version that is compatible with Python 3.12 (e.g., torch>=1.8 or a vendored dependency) while ensuring computational reproducibility.",
    "3. Supply or emulate the missing checkpoint file by adding an override (using env_override.json to specify HAL_DATA_DIR) that either provides a dummy pretrained checkpoint at './data/cache/variable/bert/resume' or points to an accessible location so that PGAT/main.py can complete its task.",
    "4. Review and update any hardcoded paths in PGAT/main.py and related modules to ensure they respect the environmental overrides, particularly for file discovery and artifact loading."
