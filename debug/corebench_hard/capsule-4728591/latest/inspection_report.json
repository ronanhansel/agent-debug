  "analysis": "The run failed because the environment lacks R (Rscript) and required R packages, and attempts to install R via apt-get were blocked by permission errors, making the reproducibility step non-executable.",

Additionally, the replication halts due to the absence of the 'bookdown' package. This confirms that the failure is due to missing system-level tooling and insufficient installation privileges in the evaluation environment.",
