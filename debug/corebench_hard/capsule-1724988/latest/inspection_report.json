  "analysis": "The run failed due to environmental limitations: the required R runtime (Rscript) is missing, system-level package installation via apt is not permitted, and the scripts rely on a hardcoded data directory (/data) that does not exist in this evaluation environment.",
  "rationale": "Evidence shows that 'which Rscript' repeatedly failed (exit code 1) and attempts to install R via apt resulted in permission errors on /var/lib/apt/lists/lock. Furthermore, the scripts\u2019 hardcoded input path (/data/...) could not be accessed because the directory is missing. These issues confirm that the failure is due to environmental barriers rather than a coding error in the agent.",

    "2. Change the R scripts so that they reference the input data directory via an environment variable (e.g. read from $HAL_DATA_DIR) rather than a hardcoded '/data' path.",
    "3. Adjust the installation flow in README.md or initialization scripts to use a conda/mamba-based installation for R packages instead of relying on system-level apt commands, ensuring compatibility with the evaluation environment.",
    "4. Include instructions in the fix-package input_override (problem_statement.txt) to bypass or modify the apt installation step, and supply necessary prompts or installation commands that work within the harness.",
    "5. Ensure that any dependency installation (especially for R) leverages the env overrides and conda channels available in the 'hal' environment."
