  "analysis": "The run failed because the evaluation environment is missing essential system dependencies (R/Rscript, pandoc, pdflatex) and it prohibits writing output to the mandated '../results' directory. Additionally, the R version in the environment (3.6.3) does not support required R packages, and filesystem permissions deny directory creation outside the working area.",
  "rationale": "The error messages such as '/bin/sh: 1: R: not found', '/bin/sh: 1: pandoc: not found', and directory creation failures ('mkdir: cannot create directory \u2018../results\u2019: Permission denied') clearly indicate that the environmental and permission issues are the root cause. The failure of R to install packages like 'scales' for version 3.6.3 further confirms that the problem is not in the agent's code logic but in the infrastructure setup.",
