    "3. Add a prompt/input override in problem_statement.txt or input_override.json to instruct the agent to bypass direct file inspection of .Rmd files and to use a fallback method (e.g., specifying expected text extraction or using pandoc if available).",
    "4. Instruct the coding agent to review the README.md for dependency instructions and check if any additional commands are needed to install LaTeX or pandoc via harness-supported mechanisms (e.g., conda or vendored dependencies).",
    "5. Ensure that the fix package makes modifications at the environment and prompt/input level only, to work within the constraints of the evaluation environment."
