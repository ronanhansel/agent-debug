  "analysis": "The run failed due to critical environmental barriers: the R package 'papaja' required for the manuscript rendering is not available from conda-forge, and the TeX Live toolchain is missing essential components (such as mktexlsr.pl), which prevents successful conversion of the manuscript to PDF.",
  "rationale": "Evidence from the error trace shows that R reported 'there is no package called 'papaja'' and conda returned a PackagesNotFoundError for r-papaja. Additionally, the LaTeX compilation failed with an error indicating 'Can't locate mktexlsr.pl', demonstrating that the current TeX Live installation is incomplete. The CSV import error further illustrates tooling restrictions in the Python sandbox.",
