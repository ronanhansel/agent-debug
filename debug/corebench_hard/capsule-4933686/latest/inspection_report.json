  "analysis": "The run failed due to missing and misconfigured system-level dependencies. The R runtime (Rscript) and the Xvfb tool are not available, and the expected output directory (/results) is absent. This is not a coding error in the agent logic but an environmental barrier.",
  "rationale": "Evidence in the log shows errors such as '/bin/sh: 1: Rscript: not found' and '/bin/sh: 1: xvfb-run: not found', along with permission errors when trying to install these via apt-get. Additionally, the missing '/results' directory further blocks output extraction. Attempts to install via conda also failed, confirming that the environment is missing the requisite R runtime and dependencies.",
