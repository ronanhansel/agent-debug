  "analysis": "The run failed because the environment lacks the necessary system-level dependencies: both Rscript and xvfb-run are missing, and the expected output directory (/results) does not exist. This prevents installation of required R packages and execution of Main.R.",
  "rationale": "The evidence shows error messages such as '/bin/sh: 1: Rscript: not found' and '/bin/sh: 1: xvfb-run: not found'. Additionally, installation via apt-get and conda failed due to permission errors and an unsolvable environment, while attempts to access the output directory resulted in 'ls: cannot access \"/results\": No such file or directory'. These clearly indicate that the failure is due to environmental barriers rather than logic or coding errors.",
