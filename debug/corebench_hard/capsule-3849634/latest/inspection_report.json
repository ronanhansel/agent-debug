    "2. Add an input override (in problem_statement.txt or input_override.json) to instruct the agent to use a workaround that does not require executing system-level commands if Rscript is unavailable.",
    "3. Modify the agent overlay to use a vendored version of the necessary R runtime or an alternative method (such as using a conda-installed R) ensuring that Rscript is available within a controlled environment.",
    "4. Verify that the repository\u2019s README instructions are met with respect to dependency installation and that outputs (including expected CSVs or logs from meta-analysis.R) are written to HAL_OUTPUT_DIR, a writable directory specified by an env override."
