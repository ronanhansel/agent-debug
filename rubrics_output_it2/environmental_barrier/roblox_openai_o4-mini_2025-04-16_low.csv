Second, even after the agent vendored a local `network_diffusion` directory, running `python code/epidemic.py` still failed with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'network_diffusion'`, indicating an environment/path resolution problem (e.g., working directory / PYTHONPATH / packaging layout) that prevented the task from being runnable as required.

Third, attempts to install the required upstream dependency also failed due to build isolation issues (build environment missing dependencies like `networkx`/`dynetx`), further showing infrastructure/dependency-barrier behavior rather than agent mistakes. [T0B111:<RANGE>ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'networkx'</RANGE>] [T0B114:<RANGE>ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'dynetx'</RANGE>]

Because these constraints made it mechanically impossible to run `epidemic.py` and programmatically inspect the resulting plots/CSVs within the evaluation harness, the environmental barrier behavior is present.",roblox_openai_o4-mini_2025-04-16_low
capsule-9052293,environmental_barrier,0.00,0,"No environmental barrier is evidenced; failures stem from the agent’s own tool misuse and execution omissions rather than an infrastructure defect. The python tool forbids certain imports/functions (e.g., `import os`), and the agent hit this restriction while trying to list files, which is a tool-usage limitation, not a broken environment [T0B13:<RANGE>InterpreterError: Import of os is not allowed. Authorized imports are: ['queue', 'itertools', 'math', 'stat', 'unicodedata', 'datetime', 'time', 'statistics', 're', 'random', 'collections']</RANGE>]. The agent then attempted to read the output file using Python `open`, which is also disallowed in the python tool, again reflecting misuse of the tool rather than an infrastructure crash [T0B25:<RANGE>InterpreterError: Forbidden function evaluation: 'open' is not among the explicitly allowed tools or defined/imported in the preceding code</RANGE>]. When switching to `awk`, the error was that the expected output file did not exist, consistent with the script not having been run (or not having produced output), not with a mechanical inability to run tasks due to broken infra [T0B44:<RANGE>awk: cannot open ""results/output_TCNS_ANP_TOPSIS.txt"" (No such file or directory)</RANGE>]. Additionally, a later failure was due to incorrect code-block formatting (bash fenced code where a python fence was required), which is an agent formatting mistake [T0B27:<RANGE>Your code snippet is invalid, because the regex pattern ```(?:py|python)?\s*\n(.*?)\n``` was not found in it.</RANGE>].

capsule-9054015,environmental_barrier,1.00,0,"The run was blocked by evaluation-environment constraints rather than agent logic/coding errors. Installing required R packages from CRAN failed because compilation of a dependency (`systemfonts`) required missing system headers (`ft2build.h`), leading to failure to install `tidyverse` and downstream dependencies; this is a missing system-level dependency in the execution environment that prevents the task from being runnable as-is [T0B157:<RANGE>FontDescriptor.h:8:10: fatal error: ft2build.h: No such file or directory

capsule-9240688,environmental_barrier,0.00,0,"The transcript does not show an impassable infrastructure failure (e.g., crashed container, broken shell, missing system-level dependency preventing execution). Instead, the run is blocked by agent-side errors and incorrect parsing/assumptions. Examples: the agent misused the tool interface by embedding a bash code block instead of a python code block, causing a harness parsing error rather than an infrastructure crash [T0B47:<RANGE>Your code snippet is invalid, because the regex pattern ```(?:py|python)?\s*\n(.*?)\n``` was not found in it.</RANGE>]. The agent repeatedly referenced wrong paths (trying to run/read `classifier.py` from the repo root when it is under `code/`), leading to file-not-found errors attributable to the agent [T0B49:<RANGE>head: cannot open 'classifier.py' for reading: No such file or directory</RANGE>]. For table 1 extraction, failures came from incorrect indexing/column assumptions (e.g., attempting to index a table by column name that doesn’t exist in the computed object), again an agent logic error [T0B107:<RANGE>subscript out of bounds</RANGE>]. Even when R produced the needed numeric result, the agent failed to parse it correctly because `execute_bash` returns a wrapper including “Exit Code/Stdout/Stderr,” not just the numeric value [T0B156:<RANGE>ValueError: could not convert string to float: 'Exit Code: 0\nStdout:\n0.438\nStderr:'</RANGE>].

capsule-9832712,environmental_barrier,1.00,0,"The run was blocked by evaluation-environment issues around dependency provisioning rather than agent logic. Conda operations initially failed because channel Terms of Service were not accepted, preventing installation of required tooling/packages (e.g., the conda install attempt for R failed with a CondaToSNonInteractiveError).

capsule-9911222,environmental_barrier,0.00,0,"The transcript does not show an infrastructure-level failure that makes the task mechanically unrunnable. Instead, the observed failures are attributable to the agent’s own tool misuse and parsing mistakes.

First, the agent attempted to read README.md using a file-inspection tool that does not support .md, producing an UnsupportedFormatException (a tool-usage mismatch, not a broken environment) [T0B7:<RANGE>UnsupportedFormatException: Could not convert 'README.md' to Markdown. The formats ['.md', '.md'] are not supported.</RANGE>].

Later, the agent tried to open a file directly inside the restricted python tool and was blocked because `open()` is disallowed in that sandbox, again a tool restriction/misuse rather than an external dependency or harness crash [T0B25:<RANGE>InterpreterError: Forbidden function evaluation: 'open' is not among the explicitly allowed tools</RANGE>].

Finally, the parsing failed because the agent treated the tool output wrapper text as data, leading to a ValueError when converting 'Stdout:' to float—an internal parsing error [T0B47:<RANGE>ValueError: could not convert string to float: 'Stdout:'</RANGE>].

Although the task description mentions missing R/PDF tooling as a previous reason for failure, this run never reaches an actual Rscript/pandoc/LaTeX execution attempt or any corresponding environment error logs; the failures shown are due to the agent’s actions while the shell tool successfully reads files and returns outputs [T0B10] [T0B13] [T0B22]. Therefore, the environmental barrier behavior is absent.",roblox_openai_o4-mini_2025-04-16_low
