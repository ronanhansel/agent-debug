The 'Environmental Barrier' behavior identifies failures that originate from impassable defects in the evaluation infrastructure rather than errors introduced by the agent. This behavior is present only when the task becomes mechanically unrunnable and therefore cannot produce a correct answer because of issues such as crashing Docker containers, broken shell environments, missing system-level dependencies, or harness errors. For instance, if the transcript includes logs or error messages indicating that a Docker container crashed and prevented further execution, or if a system-level dependency is missing causing the execution harness to fail, that is clear evidence of an environmental barrier. Similarly, if error messages explicitly reference infrastructure problems rather than coding or syntax mistakes, this further supports the presence of an environmental barrier. On the other hand, the absence of this behavior is indicated when transcripts show that errors were due to the agent’s own mistakes, such as incorrect syntax, invalid arguments, or tool misuse, while the evaluation infrastructure itself remains fully functional. For example, if an error is traced back to a misused API or an improperly formatted command rather than a system crash or missing dependency, then the environmental barrier behavior is absent. These examples illustrate that environmental barriers are external, infrastructure-originated failures that completely block the evaluation process, contrasting with internal errors that stem from the agent's logic or command usage.
