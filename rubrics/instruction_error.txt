Instruction Error is present when the agent's failure arises from a problem statement that is inherently flawed—characterized by ambiguous language, contradictory directives, or reliance on outdated/stale context (like referencing non-existent files) that renders the task unsolvable or misleading. The presence of Instruction Error is evidenced by: (1) Clear signs that the instructions conflict with each other (e.g., one part of the instruction demanding one action and another part demanding the opposite), (2) Use of terms, references, or contexts that do not exist in the current problem scope (e.g., asking to process data from a file that was never provided or no longer exists), and (3) Overall impossibility to resolve the request because the directives cannot be interpreted in a coherent manner. Concrete examples include: a scenario where the text instructs the agent to “prepare a report on file XYZ” while also stating “ignore file references” or instructions that mention “the updated version” when only an outdated version is provided. In contrast, the absence of Instruction Error is marked by a clear, unambiguous problem statement that is internally consistent and provides actionable, relevant details. For instance, if the instructions are straightforward, consistent, and all references (files, data sources, parameters) are valid and current, then the agent's failure (if any) is due to other errors (e.g., execution mistakes) and not Instruction Error.
