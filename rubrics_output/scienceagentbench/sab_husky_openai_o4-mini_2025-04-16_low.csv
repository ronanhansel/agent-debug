52,scienceagentbench,1.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The run environment used for this transcript (the provided python_interpreter sandbox) is missing TensorFlow, which DeepChem requires to import and to run GraphConvModel. This is an execution environment deficiency relative to the task instructions, which explicitly state that TensorFlow/DeepChem should be available (in the evaluation container). In this run, the agent cannot proceed past the first import, regardless of code quality. | causation_reasoning: The failure is entirely caused by the missing TensorFlow dependency in the execution environment where the run was attempted. The agent's solution never reaches dataset loading, model training, or visualization because `import deepchem as dc` fails immediately. Since any valid DeepChem-based solution would require TensorFlow, no agent could succeed in this sandbox environment; thus the defect directly caused the failure. | evidence: Repeated tool failures show the same environment error at import time: ""Code execution failed at line 'import deepchem as dc' due to: ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tensorflow'"" (call_2, call_3, call_4, call_7, call_8, call_9, call_10, call_12, call_13, call_14, call_15, call_17, call_18, call_19, call_20, call_22, call_23, call_24, call_25, call_27, call_28, call_29, call_30, call_32, call_33, call_34, call_35, call_37, call_38, call_39).

64,scienceagentbench,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The only observed errors are from the interactive development sandbox's restricted runtime (missing OGGM and disallowed imports like tarfile). The task instructions explicitly warn that the sandbox blocks OGGM imports and that OGGM will be available in the evaluation Docker container. Therefore, the benchmark item itself is not intrinsically defective based on this transcript; the failure arises from attempting to execute in an environment known to differ from the evaluator. | causation_reasoning: The run failed because the agent repeatedly attempted to execute OGGM code using the provided python_interpreter tool, which lacks OGGM, leading to ModuleNotFoundError. This does not indicate that 'no agent could succeed' under the benchmark's intended evaluation environment; it indicates the agent used an inappropriate tool for execution/testing given the stated constraint. A better agent would stop trying to execute OGGM in the sandbox and instead just output the requested code (or use allowed tooling only for non-OGGM parts). | evidence: Task clarification: ""The development sandbox blocks these imports, but the evaluation Docker container has OGGM 1.6.1... Write your code as if imports work."" Sandbox failures: ""Error: Code execution failed at line 'import oggm' due to: ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'oggm'"" (repeated across call_3, call_4, call_5, call_7, call_8, ... call_38). Also: ""Import of tarfile is not allowed"" indicating sandbox-only import restrictions.",sab_husky_openai_o4-mini_2025-04-16_low
12,scienceagentbench,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The only observed errors are ModuleNotFoundError for DeepPurpose, but these occur inside the development sandbox's `python_interpreter`, which (per task instructions) explicitly blocks DeepPurpose imports. The benchmark item itself specifies that the evaluation Docker container has DeepPurpose installed and that imports should be written as if they work. No evidence is provided that the evaluation container would lack DeepPurpose, that dataset files are missing/corrupt, that the task is ambiguous, or that evaluation would reject valid outputs. | causation_reasoning: The run failed because the agent repeatedly attempted to execute DeepPurpose-dependent code using the sandbox tool despite the instruction that the sandbox blocks those imports. This is an agent workflow/capability issue (ignoring/overriding known environment constraints) rather than an intrinsic benchmark defect. A better agent would stop trying to execute in the sandbox and simply produce the required final code for the evaluation container. | evidence: Task clarification: ""The development sandbox blocks these imports, but the evaluation Docker container has DeepPurpose... Write your code as if imports work."" Repeated sandbox failures: ""Code execution failed at line 'from DeepPurpose import utils, dataset, DTI' due to: ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'DeepPurpose'"" (call_2, call_3, call_4, call_5, call_7, call_8, ... call_40).",sab_husky_openai_o4-mini_2025-04-16_low
74,scienceagentbench,1.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The task requires OGGM (and even mandates OGGM-specific imports) and claims it is available in the evaluation container. However, in this run the execution environment used for tool-based execution does not have the `oggm` package installed, producing `ModuleNotFoundError`. This is an execution environment deficiency relative to the benchmark item requirements (Category 6: Execution Environment Issues). | causation_reasoning: The failure occurs immediately at `import oggm`, before any agent logic can run. Since importing OGGM is required by the task and cannot succeed in the provided execution environment, no agent could complete the task in this environment; thus the benchmark/environment defect directly caused the failure. | evidence: Repeated tool failures: ""Code execution failed at line 'import oggm' due to: ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'oggm'"" (call_2, call_3, call_4, call_5, call_7, call_8, call_9, call_10, call_12, call_13, call_14, call_15, call_17, call_18, call_19, call_20, call_22, call_23, call_24, call_25, call_27, call_28, call_29, call_30, call_32, call_33, call_34, call_35, call_37, call_38, call_39).",sab_husky_openai_o4-mini_2025-04-16_low
95,scienceagentbench,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The only observed error is from the development sandbox tool (`python_interpreter`) lacking TensorFlow, which the task explicitly warns about (""development sandbox blocks these imports"" and ""evaluation Docker container has... TensorFlow ... and DeepChem properly configured""). That is not an intrinsic defect in the benchmark item (dataset/instructions/evaluation/gold/environment-for-eval), but a known limitation of the interactive sandbox. The benchmark specification itself is coherent and provides explicit imports, file paths, featurizer configuration, training procedure, and output path. | causation_reasoning: The run failed because the agent repeatedly attempted to execute DeepChem code in the sandbox despite clear instructions that imports will fail there. This is an agent execution/planning issue (ignoring environment constraint), not something that would prevent success in the evaluation Docker where TensorFlow is available. A capable agent would stop using `python_interpreter` for DeepChem execution and simply output the required code. | evidence: Task states: ""The development sandbox blocks these imports, but the evaluation Docker container has Python 3.10, TensorFlow 2.17, and DeepChem properly configured."" Repeated sandbox failure: ""Error: Code execution failed at line 'import deepchem as dc' due to: ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tensorflow'"" (e.g., call_2, call_3, call_4, call_7, call_15, call_17, call_22, call_25, call_29, call_30, call_32, call_42, call_43).",sab_husky_openai_o4-mini_2025-04-16_low
102,scienceagentbench,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The repeated errors arise from running in the development sandbox where `modnet` is not installed and where `python_interpreter` forbids file I/O via `open`. The task instructions explicitly state: ""The development sandbox blocks these imports, but the evaluation Docker container can install MODNet if it detects the imports via pipreqs. Write your code as if imports work."" Therefore, the benchmark is intentionally designed so local execution in this sandbox will fail; success is judged in the evaluation Docker container. This is not an intrinsic benchmark defect; it is a misuse of the sandbox execution tool by the agent. | causation_reasoning: The run failed because the agent repeatedly attempted to execute the solution using `python_interpreter`, which predictably fails on `import modnet` in this sandbox, and later fails on forbidden `open` calls. A competent agent should stop executing in the sandbox and simply output the final code (as instructed). Since the benchmark explicitly warns about the sandbox limitation and provides how to proceed, a better agent could have succeeded; thus failure is due to agent behavior, not an IFE. | evidence: 1) Sandbox modnet import failure repeatedly: ""Error: Code execution failed at line 'from modnet.models import MODNetModel' due to: ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'modnet'"" (e.g., call_2, call_3, call_4, ... call_49).
2) Task clarifies this is expected and to still write code: ""The development sandbox blocks these imports, but the evaluation Docker container can install MODNet if it detects the imports via pipreqs. Write your code as if imports work.""
3) Sandbox forbids file I/O with open: ""InterpreterError: Forbidden function evaluation: 'open' is not among the explicitly allowed tools"" (call_17).",sab_husky_openai_o4-mini_2025-04-16_low
97,scienceagentbench,1.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The run repeatedly fails at the very first import step because the execution environment used for tool-based validation lacks TensorFlow, which DeepChem requires. This is an execution environment/package availability issue: DeepChem cannot be imported due to a missing dependency (tensorflow). Given the task's mandated use of DeepChem CGCNN, the code cannot be executed/trained/predicted in this environment as configured. | causation_reasoning: The failure is entirely due to the missing TensorFlow dependency: every attempt crashes before any dataset loading, featurization, training, or file writing can occur. Since the import is required by the task (and explicitly required imports are mandated), no agent can succeed in this sandbox environment without TensorFlow. Thus the environment defect directly caused the failure. | evidence: Multiple tool executions fail identically at import time: ""Code execution failed at line 'import deepchem as dc' due to: ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tensorflow'"" (e.g., call_2, call_3, call_4, call_5, call_7, call_8, call_10, call_12, call_13, call_14, call_15, call_17, call_18, call_19, call_20, call_22, call_23, call_24, call_25, call_27, call_28, call_29, call_30, call_32, call_33, call_34, call_35, call_37, call_38, call_39, call_40, call_42, call_43, call_44, call_45).",sab_husky_openai_o4-mini_2025-04-16_low
