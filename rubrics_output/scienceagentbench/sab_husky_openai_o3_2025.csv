97,scienceagentbench,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The observed error occurs in the development sandbox tooling (python_interpreter) which explicitly lacks TensorFlow/DeepChem support. The task instructions already warn: ""The development sandbox blocks these imports, but the evaluation Docker container has Python 3.10, TensorFlow 2.17, DGL, and DeepChem's CGCNN properly configured."" Therefore this is not a benchmark intrinsic defect (dataset/instructions/eval script/gold/env in the actual evaluation container), but a misuse of the sandbox for runtime testing. No evidence shows missing files, ambiguous output spec, or evaluation defects in the actual benchmark container. | causation_reasoning: The run 'failed' because the agent repeatedly tried to execute DeepChem code in the sandbox environment where TensorFlow is missing, triggering ModuleNotFoundError. Since the benchmark explicitly states the evaluation container has TensorFlow/DeepChem installed, a correct agent would stop attempting local execution and simply output the required code. Thus the failure is due to agent behavior (capability/process), not an intrinsic benchmark defect that would prevent any agent from succeeding. | evidence: Sandbox execution error repeated multiple times: ""Code execution failed at line 'import deepchem as dc' due to: ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tensorflow'"" (e.g., call_2, call_3, call_4, call_5, ... call_50).

74,scienceagentbench,1.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The run environment used for this transcript (the provided python_interpreter tool) does not have OGGM installed, but the task requires OGGM imports and execution. This is an execution environment mismatch: the benchmark/task instructions explicitly state that OGGM is installed in the evaluation Docker, while the development sandbox blocks these imports. In this transcript, the only observed failure mode is ModuleNotFoundError on importing oggm, indicating that the environment available to the agent during the run cannot satisfy the task requirements. | causation_reasoning: The failure is entirely caused by the missing OGGM package in the execution environment used in the run. The agent repeatedly produced plausible OGGM-based solutions, but every attempted execution aborted at the first line `import oggm`. Since no OGGM code could run at all, the task could not be completed in this environment regardless of agent capability. | evidence: Multiple executions fail immediately at import: ""Error: Code execution failed at line 'import oggm' due to: ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'oggm'"" (call_2, call_3, call_4, call_5, call_7, call_8, call_9, call_10, call_12, call_13, call_14, call_15, call_17, call_18, call_19, call_20, call_22, call_23, call_24, call_25, call_27, call_28, call_29, call_30, call_32, call_33, call_34, call_35, call_37, call_38, call_40, call_42, call_44, call_45, call_47, call_48).

12,scienceagentbench,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: No intrinsic benchmark defect is evidenced. The transcript shows the agent repeatedly attempting to execute DeepPurpose code inside the development sandbox despite the task explicitly stating that the sandbox blocks these imports and that DeepPurpose will only be available in the evaluation container. This is not a dataset, instruction, evaluation, gold program, or environment defect in the benchmark; it is an agent-side process failure (using the wrong execution environment for testing). | causation_reasoning: The run failed because the agent kept calling the sandbox execution tool (python_interpreter) which cannot import DeepPurpose, triggering ModuleNotFoundError. A capable agent could succeed by (a) not attempting to execute DeepPurpose in the sandbox and simply outputting the final code as required, and/or (b) testing only non-DeepPurpose parts (file parsing, output formatting) in the sandbox. The benchmark instructions even warned: 'The development sandbox blocks these imports... Write your code as if imports work.' Thus failure is not caused by an intrinsic formation error. | evidence: Task instruction: ""The development sandbox blocks these imports, but the evaluation Docker container has DeepPurpose... Write your code as if imports work."" Repeated sandbox execution failures: ""Code execution failed at line 'from DeepPurpose import utils, dataset, DTI' due to: ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'DeepPurpose'"" (call_2, call_3, call_4, call_5, call_7, call_8, call_9, call_10, call_12, call_13, call_14, call_15, call_17, call_18, call_19, call_20, call_22, call_23, call_24, call_25, call_27, call_28, call_30, call_33, call_34, call_35, call_37, call_38, call_39, call_40, call_42, call_43, call_44, call_45, call_47, call_48, call_49, call_50).",sab_husky_openai_o3_2025
52,scienceagentbench,1.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The run transcript shows that within the benchmark's provided execution tooling/sandbox, importing DeepChem fails due to a missing TensorFlow dependency (ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tensorflow'). Since the task requires mandatory imports of DeepChem/TensorFlow-dependent components at the top of the solution, any solution executed in this sandbox cannot run. This is an execution-environment mismatch between the task's stated environment (TensorFlow 2.17 preinstalled) and the actual environment used during the run (no TensorFlow). | causation_reasoning: The agent's attempts consistently fail at the first required import line, before any dataset loading, training, or visualization logic can execute. This indicates the failure is caused by the environment lacking TensorFlow, not by the agent's scientific reasoning or implementation. Given the hard requirement that the final code include DeepChem imports, no agent could successfully execute the code in this environment; thus the benchmark setup caused the failure. | evidence: Multiple tool executions fail immediately at the same point: ""Code execution failed at line 'import deepchem as dc' due to: ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tensorflow'"" (e.g., call_2, call_4, call_5, call_7, call_8, call_9, call_10, call_12, call_13, call_14, call_15, call_17, call_18, call_19, call_20, call_22, call_23, call_24, call_25, call_27, call_28, call_29, call_30, call_32, call_33, call_34, call_35, call_37, call_38, call_39, call_40, call_42, call_43, call_44, call_45, call_47, call_48, call_49, call_50).

64,scienceagentbench,1.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The run environment used for executing the agent's code in this transcript does not have OGGM installed/importable, despite the benchmark instructions claiming the evaluation environment has OGGM and dependencies pre-installed. This mismatch indicates an intrinsic formation defect: the task requires OGGM, and the execution environment in which the run is being judged cannot satisfy the required imports (ModuleNotFoundError for 'oggm'). | causation_reasoning: The failure is entirely due to the environment not providing OGGM; every attempt to execute any solution fails immediately at `import oggm` before any task logic can run. Since the task explicitly mandates OGGM imports and OGGM usage, no agent could succeed in this execution environment. The agent repeatedly produced reasonable OGGM-based scripts, but execution never progressed past the missing dependency. | evidence: Multiple executions fail at the same point: ""Code execution failed at line 'import oggm' due to: ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'oggm'"" (e.g., call_3, call_4, call_5, call_7, call_8, call_9, call_10, call_12, call_13, call_14, call_15, call_17, call_18, call_19, call_20, call_22, call_23, call_24, call_25, call_27, call_28, call_29, call_30, call_32, call_33, call_34, call_35, call_37, call_38, call_39, call_40, call_42, call_44, call_45, call_47, call_48, call_49, call_50, call_52, call_53).

102,scienceagentbench,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The transcript shows a mismatch between the interactive sandbox (used by the agent/tooling during the run) and the stated evaluation Docker environment. The task explicitly states that the development sandbox blocks `modnet` imports and that the evaluation container will install MODNet when it detects specific import lines. However, the run environment repeatedly attempts to execute the code in a sandbox where `modnet` is not installed, producing unavoidable `ModuleNotFoundError`. This is an environment/tooling mismatch relative to the task's stated assumptions, i.e., a benchmark/run-setup deficiency in the interactive setting (not necessarily in the evaluation container). | causation_reasoning: Despite the environment mismatch, the agent could have succeeded at the benchmark objective by simply outputting the final code block without repeatedly executing it in the sandbox. The task was to ""reply with a Python 3 solution"" and acknowledged imports would fail in the sandbox. The agent's failure occurred because it kept retrying execution via `python_interpreter` and eventually responded without a code block (triggering the parsing error). These are agent/run-strategy issues (ignoring instructions about sandbox import blocking and output requirements), not a defect that makes the benchmark unsolvable in the evaluation container. | evidence: Task instruction: ""The development sandbox blocks these imports, but the evaluation Docker container can install MODNet if it detects the imports via pipreqs. Write your code as if imports work."" Repeated runtime error: ""Code execution failed at line 'from modnet.models import MODNetModel' due to: ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'modnet'"" (call_2, call_3, call_4, ...).

This is explicitly acknowledged by the task: ""The development sandbox blocks these imports, but the evaluation Docker container has Python 3.10, TensorFlow 2.17, and DeepChem properly configured."" Therefore, the observed ModuleNotFoundError in-tool is not evidence of an intrinsic benchmark defect in the evaluation environment, dataset, instructions, or evaluation script. | causation_reasoning: The run failed because the agent repeatedly attempted to execute the DeepChem code using the provided `python_interpreter` tool, which lacks TensorFlow, despite the task clarifying that imports are blocked in the sandbox and should be assumed to work only in the evaluation container. A better agent would stop trying to run DeepChem in the sandbox and simply output the required final code block; the task is solvable. Additionally, at one point the agent produced no code block (triggering a parsing failure), which is an agent output-format error. | evidence: Task clarification: ""The development sandbox blocks these imports, but the evaluation Docker container has Python 3.10, TensorFlow 2.17, and DeepChem properly configured.
