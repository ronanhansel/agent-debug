12,scienceagentbench,1.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The run failed due to environment restrictions that prevent a valid solution approach from executing: (a) DeepPurpose is not installed/available in the runtime (ModuleNotFoundError), and (b) the sandbox disallows importing subprocess (needed for pip installation workaround). Since the task explicitly requires using DeepPurpose to train/predict, a runtime without DeepPurpose (and without the ability to install it) constitutes an execution environment defect relative to the task requirements. | causation_reasoning: The agent attempted multiple reasonable approaches: importing DeepPurpose directly, using a pretrained DeepPurpose model, and installing DeepPurpose via pip. All were blocked by the environment (DeepPurpose missing; subprocess import forbidden). This prevented any implementation from training or running inference as required. Given these constraints, no agent could successfully complete the task in this environment. | evidence: 1) DeepPurpose unavailable: ""Error: Code execution failed at line 'from DeepPurpose import models, utils' due to: ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'DeepPurpose'"" (call_3).
2) Cannot install via pip because subprocess import forbidden: ""InterpreterError: Import of subprocess is not allowed"" (call_2, call_4, call_5, call_7).
3) Agent explicitly tries pip installation in fallback blocks and hits the restriction: ""subprocess.check_call([sys.executable, '-m', 'pip', 'install' ...])"" followed by the above InterpreterError.",sab_cow_openai_o3_2025
24,scienceagentbench,1.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The run environment shown in the transcript imposes nonstandard restrictions that prevent normal Python file I/O and even common stdlib path handling. Specifically, the sandboxed `python_interpreter` tool forbids importing `os` (via `posixpath`) and forbids using Python's built-in `open()`. These constraints are not part of the task specification (which assumes reading dataset files from disk and saving an output figure) and would prevent any agent from successfully completing the task within that tool environment as demonstrated. | causation_reasoning: The failure is directly caused by these environment/tool restrictions: attempts to build file paths using `os.path` and to read files using `open()` immediately error out. While the agent later switches to `np.loadtxt`/`pd.read_pickle`, the run is already marked failed and the transcript indicates repeated forced retries due to environment errors. Since reading inputs and saving outputs are essential, and the environment prohibits standard mechanisms (and inconsistently restricts modules), this is an intrinsic execution-environment defect relative to the benchmark's expected workflow. | evidence: 1) Import/path restriction: ""Code execution failed at line 'ECG_PATH = os.path.join(DATA_DIR, \""ecg_data.pkl\"")' due to: InterpreterError: Forbidden access to module: posixpath"".
2) File I/O restriction: ""InterpreterError: Forbidden function evaluation: 'open' is not among the explicitly allowed tools or defined/imported in the preceding code"".
3) Task requires reading dataset files from `benchmark/datasets/ecg_processing_data/` and saving output figure, which is blocked by the above restrictions.",sab_cow_openai_o3_2025
39,scienceagentbench,1.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The task specification requires using ProLIF to compute protein-protein interaction fingerprints. In the provided execution environment, importing ProLIF fails because it depends on TensorFlow/Keras components that are not installed (and/or not importable as expected). This is an environment/package provisioning defect: the benchmark requires ProLIF but the container is missing a required dependency chain to import it cleanly. | causation_reasoning: The run fails before any scientific computation or plotting due to an import-time error in ProLIF (first missing TensorFlow, then missing tensorflow.keras.callbacks). Since generating fingerprints is a mandatory step and ProLIF cannot be imported, the agent cannot proceed to compute similarities/plot. Workarounds via stubbing were blocked by subsequent required submodules, showing the environment-level missing dependency prevented success regardless of agent reasoning. | evidence: Call id: call_3 Error: ""Code execution failed at line 'import prolif' due to: ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tensorflow'"".
Call id: call_5 Error: ""Code execution failed at line 'import prolif' due to: ImportError: cannot import name 'callbacks' from 'tensorflow.keras' (unknown location)"".",sab_cow_openai_o3_2025
52,scienceagentbench,1.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The benchmark task explicitly instructs using DeepChem (GraphConvModel/GraphConvFeaturizer with per_atom_fragmentation=True) to train a GCN and compute atom-deletion fragment contributions. DeepChem requires a supported backend (commonly TensorFlow). In the provided execution environment, importing DeepChem fails due to missing TensorFlow, indicating the environment is missing a required scientific dependency for the prescribed solution path. The agent's attempt to install tensorflow-cpu led to dependency conflicts (NumPy incompatibilities), suggesting the environment is not configured to support the required stack in a stable way. | causation_reasoning: The run fails at the initial step of importing DeepChem because TensorFlow is not installed. Since the benchmark's intended approach depends on DeepChem, and the environment lacks its required backend, the agent cannot proceed with the specified methodology. While an alternative non-DeepChem implementation (e.g., PyTorch GCN) could in principle solve the scientific problem, the benchmark formation directs the solver to a toolchain that is not available, and the agent's failure in this run is directly caused by that missing dependency. Thus the benchmark/environment defect caused the failure for this execution. | evidence: Failure message: ""Code execution failed at line 'import deepchem as dc' due to: ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tensorflow'"". Agent notes install attempt issues: ""pip install -q tensorflow-cpu==2.12.0"" followed by ""requires numpy>=1.25, but you have numpy 1.23.5 which is incompatible"" and ""Installing TensorFlow is problematic in this environment (NumPy version conflicts).""",sab_cow_openai_o3_2025
56,scienceagentbench,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: No intrinsic benchmark defect is evidenced. The dataset path is provided and the second attempt successfully generated and saved the required figure file. The failure arose from the agent not returning a final response in the required single Python code block format. | causation_reasoning: The run failed because the agent's final message was plain text (no ```python ... ``` block), triggering a parsing error. This is an agent output-format compliance issue, not a dataset/environment/evaluation defect. The task itself was solvable, as shown by successful execution and figure creation. | evidence: Successful execution: ""Figure saved to /workspace/environment/pred_results/temperature_statistic_vis.png"". Failure reason: ""Error in code parsing: ... regex pattern ```(?:py|python)?\\s*\\n(.*?)\\n``` was not found in it.""

63,scienceagentbench,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The trace does not show a defect in the ScienceAgentBench task specification, dataset, evaluation, gold program, or execution environment used for the actual benchmark. The failures occurred inside the interactive sandbox tool (python_interpreter) which has artificial import restrictions (e.g., blocking os/posixpath) and is not evidence of the benchmark Docker environment being deficient. Additionally, the rsp_rrv error indicates the agent provided an input format not accepted by NeuroKit2, which is an agent implementation/API-usage issue rather than an intrinsic benchmark defect. | causation_reasoning: The run failed due to agent capability/implementation errors: (1) using os in a restricted tool environment, and (2) passing an incompatible input to nk.rsp_rrv (missing troughs / wrong structure). These are fixable by a better agent: avoid os in the tool sandbox, correctly format rsp_rrv inputs (peaks and troughs) or compute troughs, and ensure correct variable definitions. Nothing in the transcript demonstrates that 'no agent could succeed' or that files/scripts are broken. | evidence: Sandbox restriction (not benchmark IFE): ""InterpreterError: Forbidden access to module: posixpath"" when importing/using os.
Agent API misuse: ""ValueError: NeuroKit error: _rsp_rrv_formatinput(): Wrong input, we couldn't extract respiratory troughs indices."" when calling nk.rsp_rrv with only peaks.

64,scienceagentbench,1.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The task requires the OGGM library, but in the provided execution environment used for the agent run, importing OGGM fails with ModuleNotFoundError. Since OGGM is explicitly required (MultipleFlowlineMassBalance, GlacierDirectory, cfg.initialize), the absence of the package is an intrinsic environment/setup defect for this benchmark item in this run context. | causation_reasoning: The agent’s code attempts to import and use OGGM correctly; execution halts immediately at import time due to the missing dependency. No alternative implementation can satisfy the requirement to use OGGM without OGGM being installed. Therefore the environment deficiency directly caused the failure. | evidence: Transcript shows: ""Error: Code execution failed at line 'import oggm.cfg as cfg' due to: ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'oggm'"" (call_3) and again ""Code execution failed at line 'import oggm.cfg as cfg' due to: ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'oggm'"" (call_7).

69,scienceagentbench,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: No intrinsic benchmark defect is evidenced. The task instructions, dataset path, and required output file are clearly specified. The agent was able to execute Scanpy code successfully and generate the required PNG, indicating the environment and data were usable. | causation_reasoning: Failure was caused by the agent returning a non-code message instead of the required single Python code block. After execution, the agent replied with plain text and then a minimal snippet that did not include the full solution, triggering the evaluator's regex/code-parsing failure. A compliant agent response (single ```python ...``` block containing the full script) would have passed. | evidence: Agent produced plain-text response: ""The UMAP visualization has been generated and saved successfully at:\n\npred_results/hca_cell_type_pca.png"" followed by evaluator error: ""regex pattern ```(?:py|python)?\\s*\\n(.*?)\\n``` was not found in it.""

73,scienceagentbench,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: No intrinsic benchmark defect is evidenced. The task instructions are clear (load two .npy arrays, average over axes (0,1), plot 200-point signals, save to a specified path). The agent demonstrated a working solution and successfully saved the required file within the run, indicating the dataset and environment are usable. | causation_reasoning: The recorded failure is due to the agent not adhering to the required final-response format (a single Markdown python code block). The evaluator repeatedly reported it could not find the required regex pattern in the submitted snippet because the agent responded with plain text status messages rather than the code block. This is an agent output/formatting error, not a benchmark impossibility. | evidence: Evaluator error: ""Your code snippet is invalid, because the regex pattern ```(?:py|python)?\s*\n(.*?)\n``` was not found in it.

95,scienceagentbench,1.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The task requires DeepChem's ScScoreModel and CircularFingerprint, which depend on TensorFlow. In the provided execution environment, importing deepchem fails because TensorFlow is not installed. This is an environment/package availability defect relative to the benchmark's stated requirements: the benchmark asks for DeepChem usage but the container lacks a required dependency (tensorflow). | causation_reasoning: The run fails immediately at import time with ModuleNotFoundError for tensorflow. Since DeepChem cannot be imported, the agent cannot train ScScoreModel or featurize with CircularFingerprint as required. This prevents any compliant solution from executing in this environment, so the benchmark/environment defect directly caused the failure, not agent reasoning or implementation. | evidence: Tool execution error repeated across retries: ""Code execution failed at line 'import deepchem as dc' due to: ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tensorflow'"" (call_2, call_3, call_4, call_5).
