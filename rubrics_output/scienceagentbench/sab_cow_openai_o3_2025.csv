52,scienceagentbench,1.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The benchmark task explicitly instructs using DeepChem (GraphConvModel/GraphConvFeaturizer with per_atom_fragmentation=True) to train a GCN and compute atom-deletion fragment contributions. DeepChem requires a supported backend (commonly TensorFlow). In the provided execution environment, importing DeepChem fails due to missing TensorFlow, indicating the environment is missing a required scientific dependency for the prescribed solution path. The agent's attempt to install tensorflow-cpu led to dependency conflicts (NumPy incompatibilities), suggesting the environment is not configured to support the required stack in a stable way. | causation_reasoning: The run fails at the initial step of importing DeepChem because TensorFlow is not installed. Since the benchmark's intended approach depends on DeepChem, and the environment lacks its required backend, the agent cannot proceed with the specified methodology. While an alternative non-DeepChem implementation (e.g., PyTorch GCN) could in principle solve the scientific problem, the benchmark formation directs the solver to a toolchain that is not available, and the agent's failure in this run is directly caused by that missing dependency. Thus the benchmark/environment defect caused the failure for this execution. | evidence: Failure message: ""Code execution failed at line 'import deepchem as dc' due to: ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tensorflow'"". Agent notes install attempt issues: ""pip install -q tensorflow-cpu==2.12.0"" followed by ""requires numpy>=1.25, but you have numpy 1.23.5 which is incompatible"" and ""Installing TensorFlow is problematic in this environment (NumPy version conflicts).""",sab_cow_openai_o3_2025

The task instructions (read .h5ad, compute QC metrics, run Leiden, plot spatial panels, save PNG) are coherent and achievable with standard Scanpy. The dataset is loadable and contains required fields/structures to proceed (e.g., obsm['spatial'] existed in the loaded object during debugging). The only encountered error was due to the agent calling a non-existent method on AnnData, not due to missing files, environment, or evaluation issues. | causation_reasoning: The run ultimately succeeded (failed=false). The intermediate failure was caused by an agent implementation mistake: using `adata.obsp_keys()` (not an AnnData method). After correcting to check `if 'connectivities' not in adata.obsp`, the code executed without crashing. Therefore, no benchmark deficiency caused failure; the issue was agent capability/implementation. | evidence: Runtime error: ""obsm: 'spatial' has no attribute obsp_keys"" and ""InterpreterError: Object AnnData ... has no attribute obsp_keys"".

39,scienceagentbench,1.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The task specification requires using ProLIF to compute protein-protein interaction fingerprints. In the provided execution environment, importing ProLIF fails because it depends on TensorFlow/Keras components that are not installed (and/or not importable as expected). This is an environment/package provisioning defect: the benchmark requires ProLIF but the container is missing a required dependency chain to import it cleanly. | causation_reasoning: The run fails before any scientific computation or plotting due to an import-time error in ProLIF (first missing TensorFlow, then missing tensorflow.keras.callbacks). Since generating fingerprints is a mandatory step and ProLIF cannot be imported, the agent cannot proceed to compute similarities/plot. Workarounds via stubbing were blocked by subsequent required submodules, showing the environment-level missing dependency prevented success regardless of agent reasoning. | evidence: Call id: call_3 Error: ""Code execution failed at line 'import prolif' due to: ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tensorflow'"".

In the provided execution environment, importing deepchem fails because TensorFlow is not installed. This is an environment/package availability defect relative to the benchmark's stated requirements: the benchmark asks for DeepChem usage but the container lacks a required dependency (tensorflow). | causation_reasoning: The run fails immediately at import time with ModuleNotFoundError for tensorflow. Since DeepChem cannot be imported, the agent cannot train ScScoreModel or featurize with CircularFingerprint as required. This prevents any compliant solution from executing in this environment, so the benchmark/environment defect directly caused the failure, not agent reasoning or implementation. | evidence: Tool execution error repeated across retries: ""Code execution failed at line 'import deepchem as dc' due to: ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tensorflow'"" (call_2, call_3, call_4, call_5).

24,scienceagentbench,1.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The run environment shown in the transcript imposes nonstandard restrictions that prevent normal Python file I/O and even common stdlib path handling. Specifically, the sandboxed `python_interpreter` tool forbids importing `os` (via `posixpath`) and forbids using Python's built-in `open()`. These constraints are not part of the task specification (which assumes reading dataset files from disk and saving an output figure) and would prevent any agent from successfully completing the task within that tool environment as demonstrated. | causation_reasoning: The failure is directly caused by these environment/tool restrictions: attempts to build file paths using `os.path` and to read files using `open()` immediately error out. While the agent later switches to `np.loadtxt`/`pd.read_pickle`, the run is already marked failed and the transcript indicates repeated forced retries due to environment errors. Since reading inputs and saving outputs are essential, and the environment prohibits standard mechanisms (and inconsistently restricts modules), this is an intrinsic execution-environment defect relative to the benchmark's expected workflow. | evidence: 1) Import/path restriction: ""Code execution failed at line 'ECG_PATH = os.path.join(DATA_DIR, \""ecg_data.pkl\"")' due to: InterpreterError: Forbidden access to module: posixpath"".

The failures occurred inside the interactive sandbox tool (python_interpreter) which has artificial import restrictions (e.g., blocking os/posixpath) and is not evidence of the benchmark Docker environment being deficient. Additionally, the rsp_rrv error indicates the agent provided an input format not accepted by NeuroKit2, which is an agent implementation/API-usage issue rather than an intrinsic benchmark defect. | causation_reasoning: The run failed due to agent capability/implementation errors: (1) using os in a restricted tool environment, and (2) passing an incompatible input to nk.rsp_rrv (missing troughs / wrong structure). These are fixable by a better agent: avoid os in the tool sandbox, correctly format rsp_rrv inputs (peaks and troughs) or compute troughs, and ensure correct variable definitions.

84,scienceagentbench,0.00,,"existence_reasoning: The transcript shows execution failures caused by the provided ""python_interpreter"" tool being a restricted sandbox that forbids many standard-library and third-party imports (e.g., it blocks os.path/posixpath and cannot support rasterio/geopandas workflows). This is an environment/tooling limitation of the interactive transcript execution, not necessarily of the benchmark task itself. The benchmark task expects geospatial processing, which typically requires rasterio/geopandas; such tasks are usually evaluated in a Docker environment rather than the limited python_interpreter tool. | causation_reasoning: The run did not fail the benchmark task: the final metadata indicates ""failed"": false. The earlier errors occurred only when trying to execute code inside the restricted python_interpreter, but the agent ultimately produced a plausible final solution script.
