102,scienceagentbench,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: No intrinsic benchmark defect is evidenced. The trace shows the agent encountering tool/environment constraints in its own interaction: it assumed dataset entries were directories and attempted os.listdir on a file, and later hit a sandbox restriction ('Forbidden access to module: posixpath') when using os.path.join. These are not benchmark formation defects in dataset, instructions, gold program, or evaluation; they are agent/tool-usage issues. There is no evidence of missing/corrupt data, ambiguous output spec, or missing required packages causing failure. | causation_reasoning: The run failed because the agent did not successfully inspect the dataset files and did not produce the required final Python solution. The only hard errors shown are from incorrect handling of file-vs-directory and restricted module usage inside the python_interpreter tool, followed by an incomplete attempt to switch tools. A better agent could avoid these issues by using execute_bash for filesystem inspection and by proceeding to write a robust script without needing restricted modules, so the task remains solvable. | evidence: Agent error when treating a file as a directory: ""NotADirectoryError: [Errno 20] Not a directory: 'benchmark/datasets/ref_index/md_ref_index_train'"".
Sandbox/tool restriction encountered due to approach: ""InterpreterError: Forbidden access to module: posixpath"".
The agent never reaches model training/prediction or saving the required CSV; the transcript ends mid-inspection attempt.",sab_cow_openai_o4-mini_2025-04-16_high
24,scienceagentbench,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: There is an execution-environment mismatch between what the task expects and what the provided tool execution environment allows. The task requires reading local files (sampling_rate.txt, ecg_data.pkl) and using biopsykit.signals.ecg, but the python_interpreter tool forbids common Python built-ins like open() and even dir(), and also restricts imports to a small whitelist that excludes pandas/matplotlib/scipy/biopsykit. This is an environment/tooling deficiency relative to the task requirements. | causation_reasoning: Despite the environment mismatch, the failure in this transcript is primarily due to agent capability/implementation choices: the agent guessed wrong BiopsyKit API names (ecg_findpeaks/ecg_correct_outliers) and then attempted disallowed introspection (dir). Additionally, the agent did not successfully adapt to the tool constraints (e.g., switching to execute_bash where a full Python environment likely exists, or using allowed file-inspection tools). A better agent could have succeeded by (a) using the correct BiopsyKit API (or checking docs via web_search/visit_webpage), and/or (b) executing code in the proper environment (e.g., via execute_bash) and correctly handling that ecg_data.pkl already has a datetime index. Therefore the benchmark defect did not uniquely prevent success. | evidence: API mismatch: ""InterpreterError: Module biopsykit.signals.ecg has no attribute ecg_findpeaks"".
Forbidden introspection: ""Forbidden function evaluation: 'dir' is not among the explicitly allowed tools"".
Forbidden file reading: ""Forbidden function evaluation: 'open' is not among the explicitly allowed tools"".
Data shape misunderstanding: ""KeyError: 'time'"" with printed DataFrame showing it is already indexed by time: ""[157279 rows x 1 columns]"" and index labeled ""time"".",sab_cow_openai_o4-mini_2025-04-16_high
39,scienceagentbench,1.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The task instruction explicitly requires using ProLIF (built upon MDAnalysis) and RDKit to compute interaction fingerprints and Tanimoto similarity. However, importing ProLIF fails due to a missing dependency: TensorFlow. This indicates the provided execution environment is missing required libraries for the benchmark’s intended solution path. Additionally, the agent encountered missing expected MDAnalysis functionality in this environment/API surface (attempted `MDAnalysis.lib.distances.contact_matrix`, which was unavailable), reinforcing that the environment does not match typical expectations for such tasks. | causation_reasoning: The run failed because the required ProLIF library could not be used at all (ModuleNotFoundError triggered during import). Since the benchmark task mandates ProLIF-based interaction fingerprints, an agent cannot execute the intended approach in this environment. While the agent attempted a non-ProLIF workaround, the task as specified requires ProLIF, and the environment deficiency prevented success along the benchmark’s described method. | evidence: Import failure: ""Code execution failed at line 'from prolif import Fingerprint' due to: ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tensorflow'"". Additional environment/API mismatch: ""Error: Code execution failed at line 'from MDAnalysis.lib.distances import contact_matrix' due to: InterpreterError: Module MDAnalysis.lib.distances has no attribute contact_matrix"".",sab_cow_openai_o4-mini_2025-04-16_high
55,scienceagentbench,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: No intrinsic benchmark defect is evidenced. The dataset is present and usable, and the environment supports running Iris code to load and process the NetCDF. The initial failure was due to the agent using an incorrect Iris API on a CubeList (calling extract_strict on the CubeList/cubes object rather than using appropriate selection methods such as iris.load_cube with a constraint/standard_name). After correcting cube selection, the code executed and produced the required figure. | causation_reasoning: The run's failure stems from an agent capability/implementation mistake (wrong method usage / wrong assumption about cube names), not from an unsatisfiable task. The agent successfully retried by loading the correct cubes via CF standard names and completed execution, indicating the benchmark is solvable within the provided environment. | evidence: Failure: ""InterpreterError: Object 0: sea_water_potential_temperature / (K) ... 1: sea_water_practical_salinity ... has no attribute extract_strict"" at ""temp_cube = cubes.extract_strict('temperature')"". Success after fix: ""Saved vertical T–S profile to pred_results/ocean_profiles_vis.png"".",sab_cow_openai_o4-mini_2025-04-16_high
63,scienceagentbench,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: No intrinsic benchmark defect is evidenced in the transcript. The task instructions are clear (file path, required plots, and explicit NeuroKit2 plotting API clarifications). There is no indication of missing/corrupt data, unavailable libraries, evaluation-script crashes, or output-spec ambiguity causing an unavoidable failure for all agents. | causation_reasoning: The run failed due to agent-side tool misuse and malformed code submission. The agent repeatedly attempted to execute `final_answer(...)` inside the `python_interpreter` tool, embedding Markdown fences inside Python strings, which produced SyntaxError/unterminated triple-quoted string errors. This is an agent capability/formatting error; a correct agent could simply output the required single Python code block (not execute it in `python_interpreter`) and succeed. | evidence: Multiple tool failures show agent formatting/tool misuse:
- ""Code parsing failed on line 1 due to: SyntaxError\nfinal_answer(\""\""\""```python              ^\nError: unterminated triple-quoted string literal""
- Repeated again: ""Code parsing failed on line 1 due to: SyntaxError\nfinal_answer('''```python              ^\nError: unterminated triple-quoted string literal"".
These errors stem from embedding Markdown backticks within Python strings and calling `final_answer` inside `python_interpreter`, not from benchmark defects.",sab_cow_openai_o4-mini_2025-04-16_high
64,scienceagentbench,1.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The task requires using the OGGM library (imports and OGGM APIs like oggm.cfg.initialize and MultipleFlowlineMassBalance). The execution environment used for the run does not have the required dependency installed (ModuleNotFoundError for 'oggm'), which is an environment/package availability defect relative to the benchmark's requirements. | causation_reasoning: The failure occurred immediately on importing OGGM, before any dataset extraction, workflow initialization, mass-balance computation, or plotting could occur. Since the task is explicitly to use OGGM, lack of the oggm package makes completion impossible for any agent within this environment. | evidence: Execution error: ""Code execution failed at line 'import oggm' due to: ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'oggm'"". Task requirement: ""Show a plot ... with OGGM ... Use the MultipleFlowlineMassBalance model.""",sab_cow_openai_o4-mini_2025-04-16_high
99,scienceagentbench,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The benchmark prompt/preview is internally inconsistent about the file type and available fields. The preview claims the file is a MuData object with modalities (gex/airr) and contains gex.obs['cluster_orig'] and gex.obsm['X_umap_orig'], implying clusters and a precomputed UMAP exist. However, inspecting the actual H5AD structure shows it is a plain AnnData-style layout with root keys ['X','obs','obsm',...], where obs includes QC fields (including 'total_counts' and 'n_genes_by_counts') but no 'cluster_orig', and obsm contains only 'spatial' (no 'X_umap_orig'). This discrepancy makes the instruction about using 'clusters' (and implicitly using the provided clustering/UMAP) ambiguous: an agent could either compute clusters/UMAP or try to use the purported existing fields. | causation_reasoning: Despite the inconsistency, the task remains solvable: since obs already contains 'total_counts' and 'n_genes_by_counts', an agent can compute neighbors/UMAP and create 'clusters' via Leiden (or similar) and then plot. The agent failed due to capability/implementation choices—trusting the misleading preview and attempting to access non-existent keys ('cluster_orig', 'X_umap_orig'), and then attempting to use muon APIs incorrectly—rather than being blocked by an impossible benchmark setup. A better agent would inspect adata.obs/obsm, adapt to the actual AnnData structure, compute UMAP/clusters if missing, and succeed. | evidence: Mismatch shown by file inspection: ""Root keys: ['X', 'layers', 'obs', 'obsm', 'obsp', 'uns', 'var', 'varm', 'varp']"" and ""obs contains: ... 'n_genes_by_counts' ... 'total_counts' ..."" and ""obsm contains: ['spatial']"" (no 'X_umap_orig'). Agent failure from missing field: ""KeyError: 'cluster_orig'"" at ""adata.obs[\""clusters\""] = adata.obs[\""cluster_orig\""]"". Agent then misused muon: ""TypeError: read_h5ad() missing 1 required positional argument: 'mod'"" and later ""KeyError: \""Unable to synchronously open object (object 'mod' doesn't exist)\"""".",sab_cow_openai_o4-mini_2025-04-16_high
