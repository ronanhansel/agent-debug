24,scienceagentbench,1.00,0,"existence_reasoning: Two intrinsic issues are evidenced by the run: (1) the environment used to execute the agent code blocks standard library path handling via os.path.join, failing with a sandbox restriction on `posixpath` (which `os.path` depends on). This is an execution environment defect relative to normal Python 3 expectations and prevents ordinary file path construction. (2) The task instruction explicitly directs using `biopsykit.signals.ecg` for R-peak detection, but within the provided environment the expected entry points the agent tried are absent (e.g., module has no attribute `ecg_find_peaks` / `ecg_peaks`). This indicates either a version/API mismatch vs the task specification or incomplete documentation of the correct callable API. Either way, the benchmark setup (library availability/API and/or documentation) is defective. | causation_reasoning: These benchmark/environment defects directly caused repeated hard failures before any meaningful ECG processing could complete. The run first failed at import-time due to missing/incorrect BiopsyKit API (module attribute errors), and then, even after switching strategy, failed due to forbidden access to `posixpath` when constructing output paths—blocking progress toward the required saved figure. Because the task requires saving to a specific path and explicitly encourages BiopsyKit usage, these environment/API constraints prevent success independent of agent competence unless the benchmark provides the correct API guidance and a standard-capable Python runtime. | evidence: 1) BiopsyKit API mismatch: ""InterpreterError: Module biopsykit.signals.ecg has no attribute ecg_find_peaks"" and later ""Object <module 'biopsykit.signals.ecg' ...> has no attribute ecg_peaks"".

These are not intrinsic benchmark defects: the dataset is readable and the function exists, but the agent used it incorrectly. The observed errors do not demonstrate missing files, missing packages, evaluation defects, or an impossible specification. | causation_reasoning: Failures were caused by agent implementation errors: (1) trying to access a non-existent 'time' column even though 'time' is the index; (2) calling predict_pipeline_acceleration without the required sampling_rate argument; and (3) then encountering an OutOfBoundsDatetime conversion error likely due to incorrect/unsafe datetime conversion handling within the agent's preprocessing or the called pipeline, without establishing that the benchmark makes success impossible. A better agent could inspect the dataframe index dtype, compute/declare sampling_rate correctly, and adapt preprocessing to the pipeline's expected input to complete the task. | evidence: KeyError from wrong column assumption: ""KeyError: 'time'"" when executing ""df[\""time\""] = pd.to_datetime(df[\""time\""])"".

52,scienceagentbench,1.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The task specification requires using DeepChem (MolGraphConvFeaturizer with per_atom_fragmentation=True and a GCN model). In the provided execution environment, importing deepchem fails because TensorFlow is missing. This is an environment/package availability defect: the benchmark expects DeepChem/TensorFlow-based workflows but the container does not include the required dependency stack. | causation_reasoning: The agent's primary approach was correct for the task (DeepChem GCN + per-atom fragmentation), but it was blocked at import time by ModuleNotFoundError for tensorflow. Without TensorFlow, DeepChem cannot be used to train/predict as required, so the task cannot be completed as specified in this environment. Subsequent retries did not resolve this because the missing dependency persisted, indicating the failure is not due to agent capability but due to the benchmark environment. | evidence: Tool error: ""Code execution failed at line 'import deepchem as dc' due to: ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tensorflow'"" (call_2).

55,scienceagentbench,0.00,,"existence_reasoning: No intrinsic benchmark defect is evidenced. The dataset loads correctly with Iris and contains the needed variables (temperature and salinity cubes). The encountered errors were due to the agent using incorrect Iris APIs/metadata assumptions (calling extract_strict on a CubeList and using the wrong standard_name), and then using a restricted module (os.path.join) in the sandboxed interpreter. These are agent implementation/environment-sandbox misunderstandings rather than defects in the benchmark item itself. | causation_reasoning: The run did not fail overall (metadata shows failed=false). Even during intermediate errors, they were not caused by missing files, corrupted data, ambiguous instructions, or evaluation defects. A capable agent can solve by selecting cubes by discovered standard_name, using CubeList.extract correctly, and avoiding os.path.join (constructing the output path as a literal string).

The dataset paths and columns appear consistent with the prompt (tree points with a Species field; borough polygons). The failures arise from incorrect use of geoplot/geopandas APIs and projections, not from missing/corrupted data, ambiguous instructions, or evaluation/environment impossibility. The errors shown are typical runtime/API misuse issues that a better agent could avoid (e.g., passing polygons to quadtree which expects points, misusing cartopy projections with GeoPandas .plot, and providing an invalid agg argument type). | causation_reasoning: The run failed due to agent implementation mistakes. First, it called gplt.quadtree on a polygon GeoDataFrame (boroughs), triggering a geometry-type error. Then it attempted to use a cartopy transform argument with GeoPandas plotting, causing an AttributeError. Finally, it passed agg=""mean"" (string) to gplt.quadtree in a way that the installed geoplot version treated as a callable, causing TypeError. These are solvable by using point geometries for quadtree, using gplt.pointplot/polyplot instead of GeoPandas .plot on a cartopy axis (or using a plain matplotlib axis), and matching the installed geoplot quadtree signature (e.g., providing a callable agg like numpy.mean or using the correct parameter name). Therefore the failure is not caused by an intrinsic benchmark formation error. | evidence: 1) Using polygons with quadtree: ""ValueError: x attribute access only provided for Point geometries"" at gplt.quadtree(boroughs,...)

The failures shown are due to incorrect API usage for loading MuData/AnnData, not missing files, missing columns, or environment/module absence. | causation_reasoning: Failure was caused by agent implementation errors in calling `mu.read_h5ad` with wrong arguments/order and misunderstanding how to load the MuData container vs modality.
