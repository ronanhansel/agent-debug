100,scienceagentbench,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: No intrinsic benchmark defect is evidenced in the transcript. The task specification is coherent (load h5ad, compute QC metrics, run leiden, plot spatial panels, save png). The provided dataset preview is plausible and does not indicate corruption or missing files. There is no shown evaluation-script crash, missing-package error, timeout, or contradictory requirements. Any potential pitfalls (MuData vs AnnData handling, existence of spatial coordinates in obsm, required preprocessing for leiden) are standard agent-implementation considerations, not proof of an intrinsic defect. | causation_reasoning: The run failed because the agent did not actually attempt the requested solution; it only produced a facts survey and plan (a different instruction-following task) and never generated the required Python code or output file. This is an agent capability / instruction-following failure, not something caused by the benchmark setup. A compliant agent could proceed to implement the script, compute metrics, cluster, and save the figure. | evidence: Agent output contains only planning text and no Python solution: ""## 1.

102,scienceagentbench,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: From the transcript, the task specification is internally consistent: it specifies required imports, the exact pickle load path for training data, the MODNetModel architecture including the 4-tuple num_neurons requirement, the dataset location, and the required output CSV path/column. No evidence is shown of missing/corrupt files, environment/module failures, evaluation-script issues, or ambiguous output requirements. | causation_reasoning: The run failed, but the trace contains no benchmark-side error (e.g., missing package, missing files, evaluation crash). The produced solution makes unsupported assumptions about how to load the MP_2018.6 dataset (uses MODData.load on a directory path without evidence that this API/path is correct) and assumes attributes like mp_data.structure_ids. These are agent implementation risks that could cause runtime failure even if the benchmark is fine. A better agent could inspect the dataset structure and use the correct MODData loading/preprocessing and prediction-to-CSV formatting. | evidence: Agent code: ""mp_data = MODData.load('benchmark/datasets/ref_index/MP_2018.6')"" and ""results_df = pd.DataFrame({'material_id': mp_data.structure_ids, 'refractive_index': np.squeeze(predictions)})"".

12,scienceagentbench,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: No intrinsic benchmark defect is evidenced. The transcript shows failures inside the development sandbox due to missing DeepPurpose and restricted file I/O, but the task explicitly clarifies these are sandbox-only limitations and that the evaluation Docker will have DeepPurpose installed and allow normal Python file operations. Therefore, the observed errors do not imply a defect in the benchmark dataset, instructions, or evaluation; they reflect the agent running code in the wrong environment and then deviating from required solution constraints. | causation_reasoning: The failure was caused by agent capability/behavior issues: (1) executing in the sandbox despite clear instruction that imports will fail there, (2) abandoning the required DeepPurpose training/prediction and producing a 'mock ranking' by PubChem CID, and (3) repeatedly using incorrect/unsupported mechanisms (e.g., calling tool functions from inside python_interpreter, using open in a restricted tool). A better agent would simply write the final DeepPurpose-based script without attempting to run it in the sandbox, and would read dataset files via standard Python I/O in the evaluation container. Thus, no benchmark defect prevented success. | evidence: Sandbox import failure: ""Error: Code execution failed at line 'from DeepPurpose import utils, dataset, DTI' due to: ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'DeepPurpose'"".
Agent deviates to non-solution: ""# Mock predictions (sorted SMILES as example)"" and ""sorted_drugs = antiviral_df.sort_values(by='Pubchem CID')['SMILES']  # Replace with actual model predictions"".
Incorrect tool usage inside interpreter: ""antiviral_content = inspect_file_as_text('./benchmark/datasets/dti/antiviral_drugs.tab')"" leading to ""UnsupportedFormatException"".
Restricted sandbox I/O misuse: ""InterpreterError: Forbidden function evaluation: 'open' is not among the explicitly allowed tools"".",sab_mate_DeepSeek-R1
24,scienceagentbench,1.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The task instruction explicitly requires using `biopsykit.signals.ecg` for R-peak detection and plotting. However, in the provided execution environment, the `biopsykit.signals.ecg` module lacks the functions that would reasonably fulfill the task as described (e.g., `process_ecg_data`, `find_peaks`, `ecg_process`). This indicates an environment/API mismatch: either the benchmark expects a different version of BioPsyKit (where these functions exist) or the task description references non-existent/incorrect APIs. This is an intrinsic formation defect because the benchmark mandates a specific module that is not functionally available as specified. | causation_reasoning: The run fails specifically because the required BioPsyKit ECG processing functions are missing from the installed package, preventing completion under the benchmark's constraint to use `biopsykit.signals.ecg`. While the agent briefly tried an alternative (NeuroKit2), that path also hit a missing dependency (`PyWavelets`), reinforcing that the container lacks needed packages for common ECG peak detection workflows. Given the task's explicit requirement to use `biopsykit.signals.ecg`, and that module not providing the needed entry points, a correct agent cannot complete the task as formed in this environment. | evidence: 1) Missing required BioPsyKit API: ""Object <module 'biopsykit.signals.ecg' ...> has no attribute process_ecg_data"".
2) Additional missing BioPsyKit APIs attempted: ""... has no attribute find_peaks"" and ""... has no attribute ecg_process"".

39,scienceagentbench,1.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The run fails when importing ProLIF due to a missing dependency (tensorflow). For this benchmark task, ProLIF is explicitly required to compute protein-protein interaction fingerprints. If the evaluation environment lacks ProLIF's required dependencies (or ProLIF is mispackaged to require tensorflow in this container), the task cannot be completed as specified. This is an execution environment defect: a required scientific library (or its transitive dependency) is unavailable. | causation_reasoning: The agent's code execution halts at `import prolif` with a ModuleNotFoundError for tensorflow, preventing any fingerprint computation, similarity calculation, or plot generation. Since the task instruction mandates ProLIF usage for interaction fingerprints, and the environment cannot import it, no agent can succeed without changes to the environment/package set (e.g., installing tensorflow or fixing ProLIF packaging). Earlier failures (markdown fences in tool call, attempting `!pip`) are agent mistakes, but the decisive blocker is the missing tensorflow dependency triggered by importing prolif. | evidence: Tool error: ""Code execution failed at line 'import prolif' due to: ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tensorflow'"". Task requirement: ""ProLIF is built upon MDAnalysis capable of analyzing protein-protein interactions.""",sab_mate_DeepSeek-R1
43,scienceagentbench,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: No intrinsic benchmark defect is evidenced. The dataset path and column name are clearly specified, and NeuroKit2 usage is feasible. The observed failures arise from incorrect assumptions about the return type/structure of nk.eog_findpeaks rather than missing files, missing libraries, ambiguous instructions, or evaluation issues. | causation_reasoning: The run failed due to agent implementation errors when handling nk.eog_findpeaks outputs (wrong tuple unpacking, then mis-indexing). A correct agent could inspect the function return (e.g., by printing type/keys) and then properly extract the peak indices before plotting. Nothing in the transcript indicates the task is impossible in the environment; instead, the agent repeatedly guessed the API structure. | evidence: Error 1: ""Code execution failed at line '_, peaks = nk.eog_findpeaks(cleaned, sampling_rate=100)' due to: InterpreterError: Cannot unpack tuple of wrong size"".

44,scienceagentbench,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The transcript does not provide evidence of an intrinsic benchmark defect (missing/corrupt data, missing required library in the environment, or evaluation script bug). The dataset appears present and readable (pd.read_pickle succeeds). Errors arise inside the agent's use of BioPsyKit, suggesting incorrect input types/structure or misuse of the API rather than a benchmark formation problem. We also lack cross-model evidence or environment logs indicating BioPsyKit is broken/unavailable. | causation_reasoning: The run fails due to agent-side handling of timestamps and API calling conventions. The repeated OutOfBoundsDatetime indicates the agent is passing datetime-like data in a form that triggers overflow in BioPsyKit/pandas conversions; a better agent could inspect BioPsyKit's expected schema and reshape/index the data accordingly (e.g., required column names like 'time'/'start', required index frequency, expected dict structure, or expected DataFrame with a specific index). The later KeyError: 'start' strongly suggests the function expects a field/column/parameter named 'start' (or a dict with 'start' key), and the agent did not provide it. These are solvable by using the correct BioPsyKit interface and input format, not by changing the benchmark. | evidence: Errors occur at the BioPsyKit call site: ""OutOfBoundsDatetime: cannot convert input with unit 'us'"" (call_2, call_4, call_7) and ""IndexError: tuple index out of range"" (call_3, call_5). Final attempt changes input to numpy array and fails with ""KeyError: 'start'"" (call_8). The data file itself loads successfully each time (e.g., ""sleep_data = pd.read_pickle(data_path)"").",sab_mate_DeepSeek-R1
52,scienceagentbench,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: There is an environment mismatch between the development sandbox used in the transcript (where the agent is being asked to retry) and the stated evaluation Docker environment. The task explicitly says the sandbox blocks these imports while the evaluation container has TensorFlow/DeepChem/RDKit installed. This is a real issue in the interactive setting, but it is not a benchmark defect in the evaluation environment itself. | causation_reasoning: The observed failure is due to running in a sandbox that lacks TensorFlow (a dependency of DeepChem), causing import failure before any dataset/model/visualization logic can run. However, the benchmark task statement asserts that the evaluation Docker container includes TensorFlow 2.17 and DeepChem, so this sandbox failure would not prevent success in the intended evaluation. Thus, the benchmark itself is not intrinsically unsolvable; a correct agent solution would succeed in the proper container. | evidence: Runtime error shown twice: ""Code execution failed at line 'import deepchem as dc' due to: ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tensorflow'"". Also the task states: ""The development sandbox blocks these imports, but the evaluation Docker container has TensorFlow 2.17, DeepChem, RDKit, and DGL properly configured.""",sab_mate_DeepSeek-R1

The task provides a dataset path and file name, a clear deliverable (Python 3 solution producing and saving a figure to 'pred_results/ocean_profiles_vis.png'), and mentions the intended library (Iris) and relevant concepts (iris.load, constraints, iris.plot). Nothing in the provided trace indicates missing/corrupt files, unavailable packages, evaluation bugs, or an impossible/contradictory specification. While the task omits the exact numeric latitude/longitude/depth ranges, this is not shown to be a blocking benchmark defect because an agent could choose and document a reasonable South Atlantic subset consistent with the data coordinates and still generate the requested vertical T-S profile and plot. | causation_reasoning: The run failed because the agent did not attempt the task at all; it only received the prompt and produced no facts survey/plan or Python solution. With no execution, errors, or evaluation feedback, there is no evidence that a benchmark deficiency prevented success. A capable agent could load the NetCDF (via iris or xarray/netCDF4), subset by lat/lon/depth, compute a vertical temperature-salinity profile, and save the requested PNG. | evidence: Transcript shows only the user prompt with task instructions and dataset preview, and no agent response/implementation: ""Now begin!

There is no indication of missing/corrupt files, missing libraries in the environment, ambiguous output requirements, or evaluator/script crashes. The failure arises before any benchmark evaluation due to agent code errors. | causation_reasoning: The run fails due to agent implementation mistakes: (1) the agent sent markdown-fenced code (including ```python) into the execution tool, causing a SyntaxError; (2) the warm-spell counting logic for consecutive True runs is incorrect and crashes with a reshape error. A correct approach (e.g., computing a rolling 5-year all-True window and summing over time per grid cell) would be straightforward and should succeed, so the benchmark did not prevent success. | evidence: Tool error: ""Code parsing failed on line 1 due to: SyntaxError\n```python\n ^"".

The dataset loads and NeuroKit2 processing runs (ecg_process output is shown), indicating files and environment are usable. The task instructions clearly specify plot API usage and saving procedure; nothing suggests an impossible or contradictory requirement. | causation_reasoning: The failure is due to the agent incorrectly assuming keys exist in the ecg_info dict (e.g., 'HR_Mean').

These are two different required outputs for what appears to be the same single plot deliverable, with no clarification whether both are required or which one is evaluated. This is a benchmark specification defect (ambiguous/contradictory output spec). | causation_reasoning: Because the benchmark demands mutually inconsistent filenames for the saved figure, an agent can follow one instruction and still fail evaluation if the evaluator checks the other path. With only one plot requested and no explicit instruction to save duplicates, there is no single unambiguous action that guarantees passing. Thus the defect can directly cause failure independent of agent capability. | evidence: Conflicting requirements in the task text: (1) ""Save the plot to 'pred_results/plotting_flowline_mb_elevation_pred.png'.""

The transcript contains only the prompt and no execution logs or errors indicating an intrinsic benchmark defect. | causation_reasoning: The run failed without the agent producing any solution or encountering any benchmark/environment error in the transcript.

The failure shown is due to the agent not adhering to the required response format (exactly one Markdown code block), which is an agent/output-formatting issue rather than a benchmark formation defect. | causation_reasoning: The run failed because the agent produced responses that the harness could not parse: first by returning prose instead of a single ```python``` code block, then by outputting two separate code blocks (one for plotting code and one for final_answer), violating the instruction to include exactly one code block. A compliant agent could succeed by placing all required code, including any final_answer call (if needed by harness), within a single properly delimited code block. | evidence: Parsing failure: ""Error in code parsing: ... regex pattern ```(?:py|python)?\s*\n(.*?)\n``` was not found in it.""
