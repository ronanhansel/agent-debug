The transcript shows the agent was able to load the dataset, compute the requested features, create the output directory via an allowed mechanism, and save the required PNG at the specified path. The only errors encountered were due to the agent using restricted modules in the interactive python tool (os.path/posixpath, subprocess), which is an agent/environment-usage mistake rather than an intrinsic benchmark defect. | causation_reasoning: Failure is attributable to agent capability/behavior: repeated violations of tool import restrictions (os.path triggering forbidden posixpath; importing subprocess not allowed) and producing an intermediate final answer that saved to the wrong path (current directory) before correcting. The benchmark did not prevent success; in fact, the agent later created `pred_results/` using `execute_bash` and saved `pred_results/spatial_2_pred.png` successfully, demonstrating solvability. | evidence: Agent error with restricted path handling: ""InterpreterError: Forbidden access to module: posixpath"" at ""os.makedirs(os.path.dirname(output_path), exist_ok=True)"" and later at ""exists = os.path.isfile(file_path)"".

102,scienceagentbench,1.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The task requires training and inference with the MODNet library, and the provided datasets appear to be pickled objects that depend on MODNet classes for unpickling/usage. However, the execution environment lacks the required `modnet` package, producing immediate `ModuleNotFoundError`. This is an intrinsic environment/setup defect: without MODNet installed, no agent can import MODNet APIs or load the provided MODData-formatted files to complete the task as specified. | causation_reasoning: The failure is directly caused by the missing `modnet` dependency. The agent cannot proceed to load training/test data, define the MODNetModel, train, or predict. Because importing MODNet fails in the environment, the task is impossible to solve regardless of agent capability, thus the benchmark defect caused the failure. | evidence: Multiple hard failures show missing dependency: (1) ""Code execution failed ... due to: ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'modnet'"" when attempting `pd.read_pickle` (call_5) and later direct imports: ""Code execution failed at line 'from modnet.preprocessing import MODData' due to: ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'modnet'"" (call_14, call_15, call_17, call_18, call_19, call_20, call_22, call_23, call_24, call_25, call_27, call_28).

12,scienceagentbench,1.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The task explicitly requires using the DeepPurpose library to train and run a DTI model. In the provided execution environment, DeepPurpose cannot be imported/used due to missing and incompatible ML dependencies (TensorFlow/Keras stack). This is an environment/package-version defect: DeepPurpose is not usable with the installed Keras/TensorFlow versions (Keras 3-related import paths), making the benchmark task impossible to complete as specified. | causation_reasoning: The agent’s attempts consistently fail at importing DeepPurpose due to missing dependencies and then due to Keras/TensorFlow incompatibility, preventing any model training or inference. Since the benchmark requires DeepPurpose-based training/inference, and the environment prevents DeepPurpose from functioning, no agent could succeed without changing the environment (e.g., pinning compatible TensorFlow/Keras). Thus the environment defect directly caused failure. | evidence: Import failure due to missing deps: ""ImportError: Please install pip install git+https://github.com/bp-kelley/descriptastorus and pip install pandas-flavor"".

This indicates an environment/package version mismatch (or incomplete installation) relative to the benchmark item’s assumptions, i.e., an execution-environment intrinsic defect for the stated requirement to use biopsykit. | causation_reasoning: The run’s failure is directly triggered by the inability to import/use the required biopsykit functionality: attempts to call `detect_rpeaks` and `ecg_process` error out with missing attributes. Because the task text pushes the biopsykit module as the intended solution path, and the environment cannot support that path, this defect prevented completing the benchmark as specified. While the agent produced a working fallback using SciPy, the benchmark still marked the run as failed, consistent with an evaluation expecting biopsykit-based behavior or code similarity. Thus the benchmark/environment mismatch caused the failure rather than agent incompetence. | evidence: Environment/API mismatch errors: ""Module biopsykit.signals.ecg has no attribute detect_rpeaks"" and ""Module biopsykit.signals.ecg has no attribute ecg_process"".

39,scienceagentbench,1.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The benchmark task explicitly requires ProLIF (built on MDAnalysis) and RDKit to compute protein-protein interaction fingerprints and Tanimoto similarities, then save a PNG. In the provided execution environment, required scientific libraries are unavailable (e.g., ProLIF import fails). Additionally, the environment/tooling restrictions shown in the run prevent standard file I/O (`open`) and even common path utilities (`os.path.join` -> posixpath), making it impossible to both compute the required fingerprints and reliably save the required output artifact from a normal Python script. This indicates an intrinsic environment formation defect relative to the task requirements. | causation_reasoning: The agent's core failure was driven by missing required packages and forbidden filesystem operations, not by scientific reasoning or implementation bugs. Without ProLIF/MDAnalysis/RDKit available, no agent can compute the specified interaction fingerprints or their Tanimoto similarities as required. Separately, with `open()` forbidden (and earlier `os.path.join` blocked), writing the required PNG to `pred_results/...png` is not feasible from a standard solution. These constraints directly prevented completion of the benchmark-required deliverable, so the benchmark/environment defect caused the failure. | evidence: Missing required library: ""Error: Code execution failed at line 'from prolif.protein import Protein' due to: ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'prolif.protein'"". File/path restrictions: ""Error: ... due to: InterpreterError: Forbidden access to module: posixpath"" when using os.path.join; and ""InterpreterError: Forbidden function evaluation: 'open' is not among the explicitly allowed tools"" when attempting to read/write files.

NeuroKit2 functions are available and usable in the environment (nk.eog_clean and nk.eog_findpeaks both executed successfully later). The output path requirement is clear and the agent successfully saved the figure to the required location during the run. | causation_reasoning: The observed failure originates from an agent mistake in handling the return type of nk.eog_findpeaks (treating it like a dict with key 'EOG_Blinks'), causing an IndexError. After correcting by using the returned array directly, the pipeline ran and saved the figure. Therefore the task is solvable and the failure is due to agent capability/implementation, not a benchmark formation error. | evidence: Agent error: ""peak_indices = peaks_info[\""EOG_Blinks\""]"" followed by ""IndexError: only integers, slices (`:`) ... are valid indices"".

The dataset loads correctly, BioPsyKit is importable, and the agent was able to compute plausible endpoints (via fallback) and format the JSON content. The failures observed stem from tool/environment usage constraints and agent-side implementation choices (e.g., trying to use web_search without an API key; attempting forbidden operations in python_interpreter), not from missing/corrupt benchmark files, ambiguous instructions, or a broken evaluation. | causation_reasoning: The run failed because the agent attempted to write the output file using Python's built-in open() inside python_interpreter, which is disallowed in this sandbox, and did not actually execute the permitted edit_file tool call to create pred_results/imu_pred.json. This is an agent capability/integration error (not using the provided file-writing tool), and a better agent could succeed by writing the JSON with edit_file (and ensuring pred_results exists). | evidence: Web search failure due to external API: ""ValueError: {'error': 'Invalid API key.

In the provided environment, the required dependency stack is not viable: importing DeepChem fails due to missing TensorFlow, and after TensorFlow installation, DeepChem cannot be installed because available DeepChem versions require Python <3.10 while the environment is Python 3.11 (as indicated by the TensorFlow wheel cp311). This is an execution environment mismatch for the benchmark item: the benchmark requires a library (DeepChem) that is not installable under the benchmark's Python version, making the specified approach impossible as written. | causation_reasoning: The run failed initially because DeepChem could not import (missing TensorFlow). After attempting remediation, DeepChem installation failed due to Python version constraints, preventing any DeepChem-based solution. The agent later attempted a PyTorch-based GCN, but importing torch raised a RecursionError, further indicating environment/library instability for standard GCN tooling. Although the agent eventually produced an RDKit+RandomForest workaround and generated an image, that deviated from the benchmark requirement (GCN + DeepChem per-atom fragmentation), and the run is marked failed.

The dataset loads correctly with iris and exposes the required cubes (temperature and salinity) with valid coordinates, indicating the files and environment are functional for the intended task. | causation_reasoning: The failure is due to an agent implementation error: treating the result of iris.load() as an Iris CubeList supporting extract_strict, but it was a plain Python list in this run. A correct agent could select cubes by iterating or converting to CubeList and proceed to plot and save the figure, so the task is solvable. | evidence: Dataset loads and cubes are present: ""sea_water_potential_temperature / (K) (depth: 40; latitude: 6; longitude: 8)"" and ""sea_water_practical_salinity / (1e-3) (depth: 40; latitude: 6; longitude: 8)"".

The task instructions are clear (including API clarifications for plotting) and are consistent with successful execution demonstrated in the run. | causation_reasoning: The run is marked failed due to agent capability/implementation mistakes during tool execution, not because the benchmark is unsolvable.

However, the runtime environment used for execution does not have the oggm package installed, producing a ModuleNotFoundError on import. This is an execution environment deficiency: the benchmark requires a domain-specific dependency that is absent, so the task as specified cannot be completed as intended in this environment. | causation_reasoning: The agent's OGGM-based implementation failed immediately due to missing OGGM.

73,scienceagentbench,1.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The run reveals a sandbox restriction that blocks standard filesystem/path operations needed for this task. Specifically, using os.path-derived functions triggers a hard failure: the interpreter forbids access to module 'posixpath'. The task requires saving to a nested path (pred_results/eeg2eeg_vis_pred.png), which generally requires ensuring the directory exists; however, directory creation/checking via os.path/os.makedirs/os.path.exists/os.path.isdir repeatedly fails due to this restriction. Additionally, subprocess is disallowed. This is an execution environment defect relative to the benchmark task expectations (a normal Python environment with basic stdlib path utilities). | causation_reasoning: This defect directly caused failure: any attempt to robustly create/check the required output directory in Python errors with the forbidden 'posixpath' access, and subprocess is also blocked. While the agent briefly used execute_bash inside python_interpreter (which likely is not available in the actual evaluation), the final delivered solution relies on os.makedirs/os.path or assumes pred_results exists, which is not guaranteed.
