100,scienceagentbench,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: No intrinsic benchmark defect is evidenced in the transcript. The task instruction is clear (load the provided h5ad, compute leiden clusters, plot spatial colored by total_counts/n_genes_by_counts/clusters, save to a specific path). The dataset preview indicates the object is a MuData with gex/airr modalities; this is compatible with a solvable workflow by operating on the gex modality and ensuring spatial coordinates exist/are set appropriately. Nothing in the transcript shows missing files, broken evaluation, missing packages, or impossible output requirements. | causation_reasoning: The failure is most consistent with agent-side implementation/spec errors. The agent assumes Scanpy's `pl.spatial` will work on `gex` without verifying that required spatial metadata exists (typically `adata.obsm['spatial']` and `adata.uns['spatial']` with library_id), while the preview only shows `obsm: 'X_umap_orig'` and does not mention `spatial` or `uns['spatial']`. The agent also uses an invalid/illogical plotting parameterization: it passes `palette='viridis' if color == 'clusters' else None`, but palettes are for categorical colors; using 'viridis' for clusters is inappropriate and may error depending on Scanpy version. A capable agent would inspect `gex.obsm`/`gex.uns`, set/convert coordinates if needed (or use `sc.pl.embedding` for UMAP if only UMAP coords exist), and call `sc.pl.spatial` with correct arguments; thus the task is solvable and the failure is not caused by a benchmark defect. | evidence: Dataset preview: ""gex: ... obsm:        'X_umap_orig'"" (no mention of `obsm['spatial']`/`uns['spatial']`). Agent assumption: ""Note: The spatial coordinates are assumed to be in `gex.obsm['spatial']`... If coordinates are in a different obsm key (like 'X_umap_orig'), modify the `sc.pl.spatial` call accordingly.""

The task statement itself is detailed and includes explicit paths, required imports, model architecture, and output requirements. There is no shown contradiction or impossibility (e.g., unavailable package in docker, missing dataset files). | causation_reasoning: The run failed because the agent did not produce the requested Python 3 solution code at all; it only returned a facts survey and plan. This is an agent capability/compliance failure (did not follow the task requirement to output a single Python code block implementing training/prediction and saving CSV).

The task specification includes concrete dataset locations and a specific API call for loading DAVIS (dataset.load_process_DAVIS), plus explicit required imports and output path. Nothing in the trace indicates contradictory instructions or impossible requirements. | causation_reasoning: The run failed because the agent did not actually execute the plan: after being prompted to proceed, it did not produce Python code, did not load data, did not train/predict, and did not write the required output file. This is an incomplete solution / agent behavior issue rather than an intrinsic benchmark defect. | evidence: After the user says: ""Now proceed and carry out this plan."", the assistant provides no code or further actions.

24,scienceagentbench,1.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The task requires reading `sampling_rate.txt` and using `biopsykit.signals.ecg` for R-peak detection/outlier correction/plotting. In the provided execution setup, the agent's code could not read the sampling rate file because `open()` is forbidden in the `python_interpreter` sandbox, and the biopsykit ECG API expected by the task appears unavailable or different in the installed version (missing documented/assumed attributes). These are benchmark/environment formation issues: the benchmark instructs use of filesystem inputs and a specific library API, but the runner environment/tool restrictions and library version do not support those instructions as written. | causation_reasoning: The run failed due to environment/API problems rather than scientific reasoning. First, attempting to read the required sampling-rate file failed because `open()` is disallowed, preventing use of the dataset as specified. Second, attempts to call biopsykit ECG functions failed because the referenced/assumed functions were not present (e.g., no `find_rpeaks`, no `ecg_process`). Even switching to a different library (neurokit2) produced an API mismatch (`neurokit2` missing `utils`), indicating instability/incompatibility in the provided environment. Given these constraints, an agent following the benchmark instruction to use the provided files and biopsykit module cannot reliably succeed in this environment without undocumented workarounds (e.g., using bash to read files, discovering correct internal APIs). | evidence: 1) Forbidden file read: ""InterpreterError: Forbidden function evaluation: 'open' is not among the explicitly allowed tools"" when reading `sampling_rate.txt`.
2) Biopsykit API missing: ""Module biopsykit.signals.ecg has no attribute find_rpeaks"" and later ""Object <module 'biopsykit.signals.ecg' ...> has no attribute ecg_process"".

39,scienceagentbench,1.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The task explicitly requires using ProLIF to compute protein-protein interaction fingerprints. However, importing ProLIF fails in the provided environment because it triggers a missing dependency (tensorflow). This indicates the benchmark environment lacks required dependencies for the intended solution path (ProLIF-based workflow). | causation_reasoning: The run fails immediately at `import prolif` with a ModuleNotFoundError for tensorflow, preventing any ProLIF-based fingerprinting and thus blocking completion of the specified task. Although the agent attempted a different RDKit-only workaround, that deviates from the required ProLIF interaction fingerprint methodology and also encountered a separate TypeError. The primary blocking issue remains that the benchmark's stated required tool (ProLIF) is unusable in the environment due to missing dependencies, so a compliant solution cannot run as intended. | evidence: Trace shows repeated environment import failure: ""Code execution failed at line 'import prolif' due to: ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tensorflow'"" (call_2) and again ""Code execution failed at line 'import prolif' due to: ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tensorflow'"" (call_3).

The dataset preview shows the required column (vEOG). The observed errors are consistent with the agent misunderstanding the return type/API of nk.eog_findpeaks rather than any missing files, broken environment, or evaluation mismatch. No evidence in the trace suggests missing packages (e.g., ModuleNotFoundError) or corrupted data. | causation_reasoning: Failure was caused by incorrect handling of nk.eog_findpeaks output. The agent first attempted to unpack two values (""_, peaks = nk.eog_findpeaks(...)""), then assumed the output was a dict with key ""EOG_Blinks"", then attempted to call .keys() on what is actually a numpy array. A correct agent would inspect documentation or print the return type once, then use the returned indices properly and proceed to plotting/saving, which is feasible in this environment. | evidence: Execution error: ""Code execution failed at line '_, peaks = nk.eog_findpeaks(cleaned, sampling_rate=100)' due to: InterpreterError: Cannot unpack tuple of wrong size"".
Then: ""peaks = peaks_info[\""EOG_Blinks\""]"" leading to ""IndexError: only integers, slices ... are valid indices"" (indicating peaks_info is not a dict).

44,scienceagentbench,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The transcript does not provide evidence of an intrinsic benchmark defect (missing/corrupt data, missing library, broken evaluation, etc.). The dataset appears to load, and BioPsyKit imports successfully, so there is no clear dataset or environment failure shown. The repeated OutOfBoundsDatetime errors are likely due to how the agent/tooling is executing the code (notably, the run uses the restricted `python_interpreter` tool that does not allow importing pandas/biopsykit, yet the agent attempts those imports), and/or due to incorrect handling of time/index passed into the pipeline. Without evidence that the benchmark itself makes success impossible (e.g., all agents get the same library/environment error), this cannot be labeled an IFE. | causation_reasoning: Failure stems from agent-side execution/implementation issues: (1) initially missing a required argument (`sampling_rate`), and (2) then repeatedly triggering `OutOfBoundsDatetime` within the pipeline call without isolating the true cause (e.g., inspecting the pipeline’s expectations, checking for any bad timestamps/units, resampling/downsampling, passing an explicit time vector rather than relying on index, or using the correct execution environment). Additionally, the agent performs expensive per-row index mapping/list comprehensions on a likely large dataset, hitting the interpreter operation limit, which is an avoidable agent strategy issue. These are solvable with a better approach and correct environment usage, so not an intrinsic benchmark defect. | evidence: Agent error: ""TypeError: predict_pipeline_acceleration() missing 1 required positional argument: 'sampling_rate'"".
Repeated failure inside pipeline: ""OutOfBoundsDatetime: cannot convert input with unit 'us'"" on the call to predict_pipeline_acceleration() across multiple retries.

52,scienceagentbench,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: There is an environment mismatch between the interactive development sandbox and the stated evaluation container. The task explicitly says ""The development sandbox blocks these imports"" while also claiming the evaluation Docker has TensorFlow/DeepChem/RDKit installed. The observed error (TensorFlow missing) confirms the sandbox cannot run the required stack, but that is not necessarily a benchmark defect in the actual ScienceAgentBench evaluation environment. | causation_reasoning: The run failed because the agent attempted to execute DeepChem code inside the development sandbox despite the instructions warning that imports are blocked there. This is an agent execution-strategy issue: the agent should have avoided tool execution/testing and just produced the final code intended for the evaluation container. Since the evaluation container is claimed to have the dependencies, a correct agent could succeed by outputting code without trying to run it in-sandbox; thus the benchmark itself is not proven impossible. | evidence: Task instruction: ""The development sandbox blocks these imports, but the evaluation Docker container has TensorFlow 2.17, DeepChem, RDKit, and DGL properly configured.

55,scienceagentbench,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: No intrinsic benchmark defect is evidenced. The dataset loads correctly with Iris and contains the required cubes and coordinates (temperature, salinity, depth/lat/lon). The initial failure was due to the agent applying overly restrictive/incorrect constraints and incorrect constraint construction, not due to missing files, environment/library absence, or ambiguous output specs preventing success. | causation_reasoning: The run failure was triggered by an agent-side ConstraintMismatchError (“no cubes found”) caused by mismatched coordinate ranges and incorrect use of the constraint expression (string & Constraint objects). After inspecting the file and correcting constraints to match the dataset's actual lat/lon range and using proper Constraint(name=...) syntax, the code executed and produced cubes, demonstrating the task is solvable in the given environment. The run is marked failed likely because the agent did not provide the required final response format (a single Python code block) and instead issued an incorrect 'final_answer(...)' snippet, which is an agent output/formatting error rather than a benchmark defect. | evidence: Failure: ""ConstraintMismatchError: no cubes found"" after attempting to load with lat -35 to -10, lon 330-360, depth 0-1000 and using ""'sea_water_potential_temperature' & lat_con & lon_con & depth_con"".

56,scienceagentbench,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The run environment/tooling is restrictive in a non-standard way: using os.path.join triggered an error about forbidden access to module posixpath. This indicates a sandbox limitation in the provided python_interpreter tool rather than a scientific-task defect. This is an environment issue, but it is not intrinsic to the benchmark task specification/dataset; a normal Python runtime would allow posixpath. | causation_reasoning: The agent could have succeeded within the same restricted environment by avoiding os.path.join/posixpath (e.g., using a literal path 'pred_results/temperature_statistic_vis.png' as done earlier, or string concatenation) and also by importing the correct Iris analysis module earlier (import iris.analysis). The failure is therefore due to agent implementation choices under the sandbox constraints, not an intrinsic benchmark impossibility. | evidence: Error: ""Code execution failed ... due to: InterpreterError: Forbidden access to module: posixpath"" at the line using ""os.path.join(output_dir, 'temperature_statistic_vis.png')"".

The dataset preview shows expected columns (ECG, RSP). The runtime errors encountered are consistent with incorrect assumptions about NeuroKit2 return values and misuse of NeuroKit2 HRV APIs, not with missing files, broken environment, or an evaluation defect. | causation_reasoning: Failure was caused by agent implementation mistakes: (1) attempting to read a non-existent key from ecg_info (KeyError), and (2) passing RR intervals into nk.hrv_time which expects peak indices (ValueError). A correct agent could compute mean rate from ecg_signals['ECG_Rate'] (or from peaks) and compute HRV via nk.hrv_time(peaks, sampling_rate=100) or nk.hrv(peaks, sampling_rate=100).

Given the task's critical requirement to import OGGM and use OGGM-specific APIs, the absence of the `oggm` package in the execution environment is an intrinsic environment/setup defect relative to the benchmark's stated assumptions (that OGGM 1.6.1 is pre-installed in the evaluation container). Without OGGM installed, no agent can execute any valid solution code for this task. | causation_reasoning: The failure is fully explained by the missing `oggm` module. The agent never reaches any task logic (data extraction, OGGM workflow, plotting).

The only observed execution attempt uses a restricted python tool that cannot import scanpy, which is an agent/tooling misuse rather than a benchmark intrinsic defect. | causation_reasoning: Failure is due to agent capability/execution issues: it attempted to run scanpy code via the provided `python_interpreter` tool which (per tool description) only allows a small set of standard-library imports, so the run cannot actually execute as intended. Additionally, the first code sample mixes `sc.pl.umap(..., save=...)` (which saves under Scanpy's default `figures/` directory) with a separate matplotlib save to `pred_results/`, risking incorrect/duplicated saving behavior.
