The dataset preview indicates the file exists and is readable as an AnnData/MuData object. There is no sign of missing files, missing libraries, evaluation-script issues, or ambiguous output requirements in the trace. | causation_reasoning: The failure is attributable to the agent not executing the requested work: it produced no facts survey, no plan, and no Python solution, and did not attempt any tool calls or data loading/plotting.

The task instructions are detailed (explicit imports, pickle load path, architecture, output path/column). No evidence is provided of missing data or broken evaluation/environment; the run ends before any attempt to execute the plan or interact with files. | causation_reasoning: The failure is attributable to the agent not proceeding to implement/execute the required Python solution after being instructed to 'carry out this plan'. Since no code was produced and no tool calls/execution occurred, there is no indication that an intrinsic benchmark defect prevented success; a better/complete agent response could have satisfied the task. | evidence: After the user says 'Now proceed and carry out this plan.', the agent provides no Python solution; the run metadata shows failure: {""task_id"":""102"",""failed"":true} with no subsequent code/output or error messages indicating dataset/evaluation/environment defects.",sab_mate_openai_gpt-5-mini_2025
12,scienceagentbench,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: No intrinsic benchmark defect is evidenced. The task instructions explicitly warn that the development sandbox blocks DeepPurpose imports, while the evaluation container has DeepPurpose installed. The agent's failures occurred only because it repeatedly attempted to execute DeepPurpose code in the sandbox using the provided python_interpreter tool, which lacks DeepPurpose. This is an agent execution-strategy mistake, not a benchmark defect. The benchmark even provides the correct expectation ('Write your code as if imports work'). | causation_reasoning: Failure was caused by the agent repeatedly calling python_interpreter (sandbox) despite clear instruction that DeepPurpose imports will fail there. A correct agent would simply output the final Python solution (with required imports) without trying to run it in this environment. The last attempt indicates the agent could have succeeded by directly returning the code (using final_answer) without executing DeepPurpose. Thus the task is solvable and the failure is agent-caused. | evidence: Instruction: ""The development sandbox blocks these imports, but the evaluation Docker container has DeepPurpose... Write your code as if imports work.""
Repeated sandbox execution failure: ""Code execution failed at line 'from DeepPurpose import utils, dataset, DTI' due to: ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'DeepPurpose'"" (call_2, call_3, call_4, call_8).
Agent acknowledged but still executed: ""The sandbox cannot import DeepPurpose... I will not execute the code here"" followed by another python_interpreter call that again imports DeepPurpose.",sab_mate_openai_gpt-5-mini_2025
24,scienceagentbench,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: No intrinsic ScienceAgentBench benchmark defect is evidenced. The dataset paths and file previews look coherent (sampling_rate.txt contains a parseable numeric string; ECG data preview shows plausible columns). The failure occurs inside the restricted python_interpreter tool due to its sandbox import/path limitations, not due to missing/corrupt benchmark files or unclear task specification. This is not an IFE of the benchmark item; it is an agent/tooling mismatch and implementation issue (attempting to run full scientific stack inside the restricted interpreter, and not using execute_bash / proper runtime). | causation_reasoning: The run failed because the agent attempted execution within python_interpreter, which forbids common modules (subprocess, posixpath) and appears to behave unexpectedly when reading/parsing files, leading to repeated runtime errors. A better agent could have succeeded by (a) using execute_bash to run a standalone script in the normal container Python environment (where pandas/numpy/matplotlib/biopsykit would be available if installed), or (b) avoiding the restricted tool entirely and just outputting final code as required. Thus the failure is attributable to agent capability/tool-use errors, not an intrinsic benchmark defect that would prevent any agent from succeeding. | evidence: Sandbox/import restrictions: ""Warning: Could not install biopsykit: Import of subprocess is not allowed."" and ""InterpreterError: Forbidden access to module: posixpath"".
Repeated runtime failure at sampling-rate parse despite content: ""ValueError: Could not parse sampling rate from benchmark/datasets/ecg_processing_data/sampling_rate.txt: 256.0"".

39,scienceagentbench,1.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The run reveals a systemic execution environment defect: the container has NumPy 2.3.5 while RDKit/MDAnalysis binary wheels are compiled against NumPy 1.x, causing runtime import failures (ABI incompatibility). This is an environment packaging/version conflict (Rubric Category 6) that prevents using the required libraries (MDAnalysis, RDKit, ProLIF) as mandated by the task. Since the task explicitly requires ProLIF+MDAnalysis and RDKit, and these cannot be imported/used reliably in the environment due to the NumPy ABI mismatch, the benchmark environment is deficient. | causation_reasoning: This defect directly caused the failure: even after pip installation succeeded, importing MDAnalysis triggered RDKit import and crashed with '_ARRAY_API not found', blocking any possible computation of fingerprints or Tanimoto similarities. Additionally, ProLIF submodule imports failed in the agent's attempts, consistent with broken/partial installation or version mismatch. Because the core required libraries cannot be used in the provided environment, no agent could successfully complete the required workflow under these conditions. | evidence: 1) After pip install verification, imports crash with NumPy ABI error: ""A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in NumPy 2.3.5"" and ""AttributeError: _ARRAY_API not found"" (trace after installing MDAnalysis/prolif/rdkit-pypi).
2) Agent observed ProLIF import failures: ""ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'prolif.fingerprints'"" (call_5, call_9, call_12, call_15).

There is no evidence of missing/corrupt dataset, ambiguous instructions, or evaluation-script/gold-program defects. The observed errors come from the agent using the interactive `python_interpreter` tool incorrectly/unsuitably (restricted imports/modules, embedding markdown fences in triple-quoted strings), which is an agent execution strategy issue rather than an intrinsic benchmark formation defect. | causation_reasoning: The run failed because the agent repeatedly attempted to execute code inside the restricted `python_interpreter` sandbox, triggering tool-specific restrictions (forbidden imports/modules) and self-inflicted syntax errors from constructing triple-quoted strings containing markdown fences. A capable agent could succeed by (a) not using the restricted interpreter for validation, and (b) simply outputting a correct Python solution as requested (or using `execute_bash` to run a real script in the container). Therefore the failure is not caused by any benchmark defect. | evidence: Tool restriction errors: ""Import of subprocess is not allowed.""; ""InterpreterError: Forbidden access to module: posixpath"". Self-inflicted syntax errors: ""SyntaxError ... unterminated triple-quoted string literal"" when constructing strings like ""final_code_block = '''```python"" / ""solution_code = \""\""\""```python"".

44,scienceagentbench,1.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The agent failures stem from a constrained execution environment in the provided tooling, not from the scientific task itself. During attempted execution, the environment blocks standard-library imports (e.g., traceback, subprocess), blocks access to internal stdlib module posixpath (triggered via os.path), and even forbids calling built-in open(). These restrictions prevent running any normal Python script that reads/writes files, creates directories, or installs/uses dependencies. This is an execution environment defect relative to the benchmark requirement to write pred_results/imu_pred.json and to use BioPsyKit. | causation_reasoning: The failure was directly caused by these environment/tooling restrictions: the agent could not execute code that writes the required JSON output file because open() was forbidden; it also could not use os.path because it triggered forbidden posixpath access, and could not install dependencies because subprocess import was forbidden. Given these constraints, no agent could successfully complete an end-to-end run within this execution channel, regardless of algorithm correctness. Thus the benchmark run failure is attributable to the environment/tooling mismatch rather than agent capability. | evidence: Multiple hard environment blocks appear in the transcript: (1) ""InterpreterError: Import of traceback is not allowed."" (2) ""InterpreterError: Import of subprocess is not allowed."" (3) ""InterpreterError: Forbidden access to module: posixpath"" (triggered when using os.path). (4) ""InterpreterError: Forbidden function evaluation: 'open' is not among the explicitly allowed tools"" (prevents writing pred_results/imu_pred.json).

52,scienceagentbench,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: A specification mismatch exists: the task requires saving the figure as ""pred_results/aquatic_toxicity_qsar_vis.png"" but also states ""Save the final figure to 'pred_results/atomic_contrib_pred.png'"". This is an output specification ambiguity (two different required filenames). | causation_reasoning: The agent did not reach the stage of producing/running a solution or saving any figure. The failure shown in the transcript is due to the agent not implementing the requested Python solution and instead making empty/invalid tool calls (python_interpreter with empty arguments) and only producing planning text. Therefore, the benchmark ambiguity did not cause this failure; a capable agent could still succeed by saving to both filenames or following the primary one. | evidence: Conflicting instructions: ""Save the figure as \""pred_results/aquatic_toxicity_qsar_vis.png\""."" and ""Save the final figure to 'pred_results/atomic_contrib_pred.png' using matplotlib's savefig().""

55,scienceagentbench,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The transcript provides no evidence of any intrinsic benchmark defect (missing/corrupt dataset, ambiguous output requirements beyond normal, evaluation script issues, or missing environment dependencies). The task specification is reasonably clear (load the NetCDF in benchmark/datasets/ocean_profiles/, compute a vertical profile for a chosen South Atlantic lat/lon/depth window, and save a plot to pred_results/ocean_profiles_vis.png). The agent never reached the point of loading the dataset or encountering any benchmark/environment errors, so there is no basis to claim an IFE. | causation_reasoning: Failure occurred because the agent did not implement the requested Python solution and did not execute meaningful tool calls. Multiple tool invocations to python_interpreter were made with empty arguments, producing no work. No attempt was made to read the NetCDF file, import iris, compute profiles, or generate/save the required figure.

There is no shown missing/corrupt data, no evaluation-script crash, and no environment/library absence demonstrated within the benchmark's intended execution context. The errors shown arise from the agent misusing the provided tooling (restricted python_interpreter) rather than a defect in the benchmark item itself. | causation_reasoning: The failure is due to agent capability/tool-use issues: it attempted to execute full scientific code (os/numpy/matplotlib/iris) inside the sandboxed python_interpreter that forbids certain modules and also repeatedly tried to embed the final script inside triple-quoted strings passed to python_interpreter, causing SyntaxError. A better agent would stop executing in the restricted interpreter and simply output the required single Python code block as the final response (as the task asks), or use execute_bash in a proper environment if needed.

The task specification is clear (required imports, OGGM init order, dataset path, output filenames) and does not inherently prevent a correct solution in the intended evaluation Docker where OGGM is stated to be installed.

The only observed errors come from attempting to execute code inside a restricted tool (python_interpreter) that is not representative of the benchmark's actual Docker execution environment. | causation_reasoning: The failure is due to agent behavior: repeatedly trying to run Scanpy/OS-dependent code in the python_interpreter tool despite prior errors indicating environment/tool restrictions, instead of using the appropriate execution mechanism (e.g., execute_bash / writing a script file) or simply providing the final required code output (as the task asks).
