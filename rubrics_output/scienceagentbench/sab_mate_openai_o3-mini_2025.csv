The agent’s code includes several risky choices that could lead to failure in a solvable task: it treats the file as an AnnData via sc.read_h5ad despite the preview stating it is a MuData object; it fabricates adata.obsm['spatial'] from UMAP/PCA if missing (may not match expected spatial plotting/evaluation); and it does not use scanpy’s built-in save mechanism for spatial plots and instead calls plt.savefig on the current figure, which could be empty/incorrect if sc.pl.spatial uses its own figure handling. These are agent-implementation/capability issues rather than intrinsic benchmark defects. | evidence: Preview indicates: ""MuData object with n_obs × n_vars = 3000 × 30727\n  2 modalities\n    gex: ..."" while the agent code does: ""adata = sc.read_h5ad(data_path)"" and proceeds as if AnnData.

The task instructions explicitly acknowledge that the sandbox blocks these imports and that MODNet is expected to be installed in the evaluation Docker container via pipreqs detection of imports. This indicates an environment mismatch: the benchmark task cannot be executed successfully in the sandbox regardless of agent code correctness, because the mandated imports cannot be resolved there. | causation_reasoning: The failure is directly caused by `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'modnet'` at import time.

A capable agent could succeed by not executing DeepPurpose in the sandbox and simply outputting correct final code (as requested) for the evaluation container. Since the task is designed to be solvable in the evaluation environment and the failure stems from the agent's execution strategy in the sandbox, this is an agent capability/process issue, not an intrinsic benchmark defect. | evidence: Task clarification: ""The development sandbox blocks these imports, but the evaluation Docker container has DeepPurpose...

The task specification is clear about the required output artifact (a PNG at a specific path) and suggests using biopsykit but does not mandate it exclusively. The environment appears capable of running the solution: multiple runs successfully executed code that loaded the dataset and saved the required figure to the correct location. The repeated failures stem from the agent not adhering to the required response format (single markdown python code block and nothing else), which is an agent output/formatting issue, not a benchmark defect. | causation_reasoning: The failure is caused by the agent returning non-code text after producing working code, violating the evaluator’s parsing regex requirement.

These are execution environment issues relative to the task's suggested approach. | causation_reasoning: Despite the above environment issues, the task is still solvable in the provided environment: the agent successfully generated and saved the required PNG multiple times using an alternative MDAnalysis+NumPy contact-fingerprint approach (without ProLIF/RDKit). The run ultimately failed due to agent output/interaction mistakes: repeatedly responding without a code block when the system expected one, and once introducing a SyntaxError in a revised code snippet (unterminated string literal).

Also, the task says ""within a specified range of latitude, longitude, and depth"" but does not specify numeric bounds, forcing the agent to choose defaults. These are ambiguities/mismatches in instructions rather than an impossibility. | causation_reasoning: The run ultimately failed due to agent-side implementation mistakes and response-format mistakes, not because the benchmark was unsolvable. The agent repeatedly responded without a required ```python code block, triggering parser failures.
