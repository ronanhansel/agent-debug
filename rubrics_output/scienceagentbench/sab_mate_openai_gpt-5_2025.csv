There is no shown missing file, corrupted data, environment/module error, or evaluation-script failure. The only observed issue is that the agent never produced any solution code or attempted the required steps. | causation_reasoning: The run failed because the agent did not implement the task: it provided an empty/placeholder plan, then made an invalid tool call with empty arguments and stopped without generating the required Python script and output image.

That constitutes an intrinsic environment defect relative to the agent-run setting shown here (missing required library). | causation_reasoning: The failure in the transcript is directly caused by ModuleNotFoundError when importing DeepPurpose. Because the required library is absent in the execution environment used for the run, no agent could successfully execute training/prediction within this environment. The agent's later failures (syntax errors) are secondary, but the primary blocking issue is that DeepPurpose cannot be imported/executed at all in this run context. | evidence: Repeated hard failure on required import: ""Code execution failed at line 'from DeepPurpose import utils, dataset, DTI' due to: ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'DeepPurpose'"" (call_5), again in call_7: same ModuleNotFoundError.

24,scienceagentbench,1.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The task explicitly instructs use of biopsykit.signals.ecg and requires reading local dataset files and producing a matplotlib figure. In the provided execution environment for this run, the only executable tool (python_interpreter) forbids importing standard modules needed for any reasonable solution: it blocks even os/posixpath and disallows builtins like dir. This indicates an environment/tooling restriction incompatible with the task requirements, i.e., an intrinsic formation/execution environment defect for this benchmark setup (Category 6: Execution Environment Issues). | causation_reasoning: The agent's failure is directly caused by the restricted interpreter preventing basic filesystem/path usage and module introspection/imports needed to load data and use biopsykit. Because these restrictions prevent any agent from implementing the required workflow within python_interpreter (and the run did not successfully switch to an alternative execution tool for the actual solution), the benchmark environment, not agent capability, caused the failure. | evidence: Observation: ""Error importing biopsykit.signals.ecg: Forbidden function evaluation: 'dir' is not among the explicitly allowed tools or defined/imported in the preceding code"" and ""Code execution failed at line 'data_dir = os.path.join(...' due to: InterpreterError: Forbidden access to module: posixpath"".

The task instructions are reasonably specific about the dataset path, what to compute (interaction fingerprints for first 10 frames), the similarity metric (Tanimoto), and the required output file path. While some implementation details (e.g., how to choose 'small' vs 'large' protein) require reasonable heuristics, that is not sufficient to establish a benchmark defect without evidence that the benchmark expects a different, hidden convention or that multiple interpretations are rejected. | causation_reasoning: Failure is attributable to the agent not producing or running any substantive solution code. The agent repeatedly calls the limited `python_interpreter` tool with empty arguments and never inspects the dataset, installs/uses required packages, computes fingerprints, or generates the required PNG. There is no indication that the environment or dataset prevented progress; the agent simply did not implement the required pipeline. | evidence: Agent outputs an empty plan block: ""Here are the facts I know and the plan of action that I will follow to solve the task:\n```\n\n```"".

No missing files, ambiguous output requirements, or evaluation/environment defects are shown. NeuroKit2 is explicitly allowed in the environment (whitelisted as neurokit2/neurokit2.*), so the benchmark environment appears capable of supporting the required solution. | causation_reasoning: The failure stems from agent-side execution and tool misuse, not from the benchmark. The agent repeatedly wrapped the intended solution inside triple-quoted strings containing markdown fences and attempted to run those strings in python_interpreter, causing SyntaxError/IndentationError unrelated to the task. Additionally, the agent attempted to import subprocess in the restricted python_interpreter sandbox, triggering an InterpreterError; a correct agent would avoid using the restricted python_interpreter for full script execution and would simply output the Python script (and/or avoid subprocess installation logic in environments where it's restricted). Therefore, a better agent could succeed. | evidence: Agent tool/run errors unrelated to task solvability include: (1) ""IndentationError: unexpected indent"" pointing into a docstring line (""Load EOG signal from a CSV file..."") after wrapping code in a string.

The failures observed are from the agent using the provided ""python_interpreter"" tool, which enforces a restricted module/function whitelist (e.g., disallowing subprocess and open) and lacks a valid web_search API key. These are tool-specific sandbox limitations during this interactive conversation, not evidence that the benchmark itself is unsolvable or defective. The task specification is clear (load pkl, run BioPsyKit pipeline, write JSON), and BioPsyKit appears to be available per allowed imports list (""biopsykit"", ""biopsykit.*""). A competent agent could write a correct offline solution without attempting forbidden tool operations. | causation_reasoning: The run failed because the agent attempted to execute the full solution inside the restricted python_interpreter tool and used disallowed modules/functions (posixpath indirectly via os.path, subprocess, open) and attempted web_search despite invalid API key.

A better agent would (1) not rely on web_search, (2) not attempt pip install via subprocess, and (3) simply output the required Python script without executing it in the restricted interpreter.

These are conflicting requirements and could confuse agents. However, this is not an intrinsic impossibility; an agent can save both files (or prioritize the explicitly required one) and succeed. No missing files, missing libraries (in the stated eval container), or impossible evaluation constraints are evidenced in the transcript. | causation_reasoning: The run failed because the agent never produced the requested Python solution and did not execute meaningful steps. The transcript shows empty/invalid tool calls and no code generation. The ambiguous filename requirement did not actually block progress here; the agent could have proceeded and saved both outputs.

The task specification is clear (compute 5-year consecutive exceedances >280K over 240 years per grid cell, plot with iris.plot, save to a specific path) and a valid approach is straightforward with Iris+NumPy+Matplotlib. The failure shown is due to the agent attempting to execute code inside the rubric/transcript tool sandbox (python_interpreter) that has explicit import restrictions and forbids modules like iris/os/path handling; this is a limitation of the transcript execution tool, not of the ScienceAgentBench task item itself. | causation_reasoning: The run failed because the agent repeatedly tried to run the full Iris/Matplotlib script via python_interpreter, which cannot import those libraries and even blocks path utilities (posixpath). The correct behavior in this setting is to output the final Python solution without relying on python_interpreter execution.

There is no proof that the dataset is missing/corrupt, that NeuroKit2 is unavailable in the real evaluation container, or that the evaluation script is defective. | causation_reasoning: The observed run failure is caused by agent/tooling misuse and insufficient robustness, not by an intrinsic formation error. Multiple attempts failed because the agent kept trying to run full filesystem/scientific code inside python_interpreter, which blocks imports like posixpath (via os.path/pathlib). This is an agent capability/strategy error in this interactive environment.
