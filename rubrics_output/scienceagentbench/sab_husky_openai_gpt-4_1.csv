64,scienceagentbench,1.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The benchmark task specification contains an internal contradiction about the required output filename. It simultaneously instructs: (a) ""Save the plot to 'pred_results/plotting_flowline_mb_elevation_pred.png'"" and (b) ""Save the final mass balance plot to 'pred_results/mass_balance_pred.png' using matplotlib's savefig()."" These are mutually exclusive if the evaluation expects exactly one filename. This is a task instruction / output specification mismatch intrinsic to the benchmark item. | causation_reasoning: This defect plausibly caused failure because an agent following one instruction will violate the other. In the trace, the agent oscillated between the two target paths and ultimately produced code saving to 'pred_results/plotting_flowline_mb_elevation_pred.png', while earlier it saved to 'pred_results/mass_balance_pred.png'. If the evaluator checks for the other filename, the run fails regardless of correctness of the plot. Thus, the benchmark’s contradictory output requirement can prevent any single solution from passing if the evaluation is strict about one path. | evidence: Task text includes both: ""Save the plot to 'pred_results/plotting_flowline_mb_elevation_pred.png'."" and later: ""Save the final mass balance plot to 'pred_results/mass_balance_pred.png' using matplotlib's savefig()."" Agent noted contradiction: ""The plot must be saved to: 'pred_results/mass_balance_pred.png' (not 'plotting_flowline_mb_elevation_pred.png', per the instructions)."" Later code saves to plotting_flowline_mb_elevation_pred.png: ""plt.savefig('pred_results/plotting_flowline_mb_elevation_pred.png')"" and earlier code saved mass_balance_pred.png: ""out_path = os.path.join(out_dir, 'mass_balance_pred.png')"".",sab_husky_openai_gpt-4_1
74,scienceagentbench,1.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The benchmark task (ScienceAgentBench task_id 74) requires OGGM and explicitly claims OGGM is available in the evaluation environment, but in the provided run environment OGGM is not importable (ModuleNotFoundError). Since the task requires OGGM-specific imports and functionality, the absence of the oggm package is an execution environment defect relative to the benchmark specification. | causation_reasoning: The agent's attempts to run the required OGGM-based solution repeatedly failed immediately at the first required import (`import oggm`). This prevents any solution from executing in this environment regardless of agent quality. The agent even produced a fallback (non-OGGM) proxy plot, but that does not satisfy the task requirements (random simulation to 2060 and distributed thickness via OGGM). Thus, the missing OGGM package (or inaccessible OGGM in the run environment) directly caused the failure. | evidence: Multiple tool executions failed at the required import: ""Error: Code execution failed at line 'import oggm' due to: ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'oggm'"" (call_2, call_3, call_4, call_5, call_8, call_9, call_10, call_12, call_13, call_14, call_15, call_25). Task statement asserts the opposite: ""The evaluation environment has OGGM and its dependencies pre-installed.""",sab_husky_openai_gpt-4_1
95,scienceagentbench,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: No intrinsic benchmark formation defect is evidenced. The task instructions are detailed (required imports, featurizer parameters, dataset paths, training epochs, output path). The agent’s observed failures stem from limitations of the development sandbox tools (no TensorFlow/DeepChem, no direct file I/O, .pkl not supported by the text inspection tool), which are explicitly acknowledged by the task as differing from the evaluation environment. This does not indicate a defect in the benchmark item or evaluation container. | causation_reasoning: The run failed because the agent repeatedly attempted to execute DeepChem/TensorFlow and open pickle files within a restricted sandbox where those operations are not supported, instead of just producing the final code artifact. In the actual evaluation Docker (per task statement), these imports and file operations should work, so the benchmark itself did not prevent success. A better agent would stop trying to run code in the sandbox and simply output correct Python per instructions, which is feasible. | evidence: Sandbox/tooling errors, not benchmark defects: (1) ""ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tensorflow'"" when running ""import deepchem as dc"" (call_3/call_4/call_5/call_7/call_8/etc.). (2) ""InterpreterError: Forbidden function evaluation: 'open' is not among the explicitly allowed tools"" when attempting to load pkl via python_interpreter (call_2, call_18). (3) ""UnsupportedFormatException... formats ['.pkl', '.pickle'] are not supported"" when attempting inspect_file_as_text on .pkl (call_17). Task explicitly notes this is expected in sandbox: ""The development sandbox blocks these imports, but the evaluation Docker container has Python 3.10, TensorFlow 2.17, and DeepChem properly configured.""",sab_husky_openai_gpt-4_1
