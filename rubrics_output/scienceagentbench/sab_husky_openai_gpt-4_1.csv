95,scienceagentbench,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: No intrinsic benchmark formation defect is evidenced. The task instructions are detailed (required imports, featurizer parameters, dataset paths, training epochs, output path). The agent’s observed failures stem from limitations of the development sandbox tools (no TensorFlow/DeepChem, no direct file I/O, .pkl not supported by the text inspection tool), which are explicitly acknowledged by the task as differing from the evaluation environment. This does not indicate a defect in the benchmark item or evaluation container. | causation_reasoning: The run failed because the agent repeatedly attempted to execute DeepChem/TensorFlow and open pickle files within a restricted sandbox where those operations are not supported, instead of just producing the final code artifact. In the actual evaluation Docker (per task statement), these imports and file operations should work, so the benchmark itself did not prevent success. A better agent would stop trying to run code in the sandbox and simply output correct Python per instructions, which is feasible. | evidence: Sandbox/tooling errors, not benchmark defects: (1) ""ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tensorflow'"" when running ""import deepchem as dc"" (call_3/call_4/call_5/call_7/call_8/etc.). (2) ""InterpreterError: Forbidden function evaluation: 'open' is not among the explicitly allowed tools"" when attempting to load pkl via python_interpreter (call_2, call_18). (3) ""UnsupportedFormatException... formats ['.pkl', '.pickle'] are not supported"" when attempting inspect_file_as_text on .pkl (call_17). Task explicitly notes this is expected in sandbox: ""The development sandbox blocks these imports, but the evaluation Docker container has Python 3.10, TensorFlow 2.17, and DeepChem properly configured.""",sab_husky_openai_gpt-4_1
74,scienceagentbench,1.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The benchmark task (ScienceAgentBench task_id 74) requires OGGM and explicitly claims OGGM is available in the evaluation environment, but in the provided run environment OGGM is not importable (ModuleNotFoundError). Since the task requires OGGM-specific imports and functionality, the absence of the oggm package is an execution environment defect relative to the benchmark specification. | causation_reasoning: The agent's attempts to run the required OGGM-based solution repeatedly failed immediately at the first required import (`import oggm`). This prevents any solution from executing in this environment regardless of agent quality. The agent even produced a fallback (non-OGGM) proxy plot, but that does not satisfy the task requirements (random simulation to 2060 and distributed thickness via OGGM). Thus, the missing OGGM package (or inaccessible OGGM in the run environment) directly caused the failure. | evidence: Multiple tool executions failed at the required import: ""Error: Code execution failed at line 'import oggm' due to: ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'oggm'"" (call_2, call_3, call_4, call_5, call_8, call_9, call_10, call_12, call_13, call_14, call_15, call_25). Task statement asserts the opposite: ""The evaluation environment has OGGM and its dependencies pre-installed.""",sab_husky_openai_gpt-4_1
12,scienceagentbench,1.00,,"existence_reasoning: The run environment used for the transcript (the provided python_interpreter sandbox) does not have the required DeepPurpose package, despite the task requiring mandatory DeepPurpose imports and usage. This is an execution environment mismatch: the benchmark task explicitly says DeepPurpose is pre-installed in the evaluation Docker, but the actual environment available in the run transcript cannot import it, making any compliant solution impossible to execute here. Additionally, the sandbox forbids file I/O via open() and the inspect_file_as_text tool does not support .tab files, which blocks even alternative non-DeepPurpose approaches inside this sandbox. | causation_reasoning: The failure is directly caused by the environment defect: every attempt to run the required solution fails immediately at the first mandatory import with ModuleNotFoundError. Since the task requires those imports at the top, no agent can produce a runnable program in this sandbox. When the agent attempted a workaround without DeepPurpose, execution still failed due to sandbox restrictions (forbidden open() and .tab unsupported by inspect_file_as_text), again preventing completion. Thus the benchmark/environment setup, not agent capability, caused the failure in this run context. | evidence: Repeated runtime error at mandatory import: ""Code execution failed at line 'from DeepPurpose import utils, dataset, DTI' due to: ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'DeepPurpose'"" (call_2, call_3, call_4, call_5, call_7, call_8, call_9, call_10, etc.).
Alternative approach blocked by sandbox I/O: ""InterpreterError: Forbidden function evaluation: 'open' is not among the explicitly allowed tools"" (call_22, call_32, call_37).
Tool limitation for dataset file: ""UnsupportedFormatException: Could not convert 'benchmark/datasets/dti/antiviral_drugs.tab' to Markdown. The formats ['.tab'] are not supported."" (call_27).",sab_husky_openai_gpt-4_1
64,scienceagentbench,1.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The benchmark task specification contains an internal contradiction about the required output filename. It simultaneously instructs: (a) ""Save the plot to 'pred_results/plotting_flowline_mb_elevation_pred.png'"" and (b) ""Save the final mass balance plot to 'pred_results/mass_balance_pred.png' using matplotlib's savefig()."" These are mutually exclusive if the evaluation expects exactly one filename. This is a task instruction / output specification mismatch intrinsic to the benchmark item. | causation_reasoning: This defect plausibly caused failure because an agent following one instruction will violate the other. In the trace, the agent oscillated between the two target paths and ultimately produced code saving to 'pred_results/plotting_flowline_mb_elevation_pred.png', while earlier it saved to 'pred_results/mass_balance_pred.png'. If the evaluator checks for the other filename, the run fails regardless of correctness of the plot. Thus, the benchmark’s contradictory output requirement can prevent any single solution from passing if the evaluation is strict about one path. | evidence: Task text includes both: ""Save the plot to 'pred_results/plotting_flowline_mb_elevation_pred.png'."" and later: ""Save the final mass balance plot to 'pred_results/mass_balance_pred.png' using matplotlib's savefig()."" Agent noted contradiction: ""The plot must be saved to: 'pred_results/mass_balance_pred.png' (not 'plotting_flowline_mb_elevation_pred.png', per the instructions)."" Later code saves to plotting_flowline_mb_elevation_pred.png: ""plt.savefig('pred_results/plotting_flowline_mb_elevation_pred.png')"" and earlier code saved mass_balance_pred.png: ""out_path = os.path.join(out_dir, 'mass_balance_pred.png')"".",sab_husky_openai_gpt-4_1
52,scienceagentbench,1.00,,"existence_reasoning: The benchmark/instructions require DeepChem (which depends on TensorFlow) and explicitly state the evaluation Docker has TensorFlow 2.17/DeepChem installed. However, in the provided execution environment for this run, importing DeepChem consistently fails because TensorFlow is missing. This is an environment/package availability defect relative to the task requirements. | causation_reasoning: This missing TensorFlow dependency prevents importing DeepChem, so no agent can train the required GraphConvModel or generate predictions/attribution in this environment. The failure is therefore caused directly by the benchmark execution environment mismatch, not by the agent's scientific reasoning or implementation logic. | evidence: Repeated runtime error on import: ""Code execution failed at line 'import deepchem as dc' due to: ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tensorflow'"" (e.g., Call id: call_2, call_3, call_4, call_5, call_7, call_8, call_9, call_10, call_12, call_13, call_14, call_15, call_17, call_18, call_19, call_20, call_22, call_23, call_24, call_25, call_27, call_28, call_29, call_30, call_32, call_33, call_34, call_35, call_37, call_38, call_39, call_40, call_42, call_43, call_44, call_45, call_47, call_48, call_49, call_50, call_52, call_53, call_54, call_55).

102,scienceagentbench,1.00,,"existence_reasoning: A benchmark/environment formation defect is present: the execution environment used for the run does not have the required domain-specific library `modnet` installed, despite the task requiring MODNet and explicitly instructing to use `from modnet.models import MODNetModel` / `from modnet.preprocessing import MODData`. Because the evaluation harness repeatedly attempts to execute the submitted code inside a sandbox where `modnet` is unavailable, no valid MODNet-based solution can execute there. This is an execution environment issue per rubric category 6 (missing required scientific libraries). | causation_reasoning: The failure is entirely caused by the missing `modnet` package in the runtime used for execution attempts. Every run stops at the first import statement with `ModuleNotFoundError`, preventing any training, prediction, or file output regardless of the agent's logic. Since the task mandates MODNet usage (and imports), and the environment cannot import MODNet, success is impossible under these run conditions. | evidence: Repeated sandbox execution failures: ""Code execution failed at line 'from modnet.models import MODNetModel' due to: ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'modnet'"" (e.g., Call id: call_2, call_3, call_4, call_7, ... through call_139). The task itself mandates MODNet imports: ""CRITICAL: Your final Python code MUST include these import statements at the top: `from modnet.models import MODNetModel`, `from modnet.preprocessing import MODData`..."".",sab_husky_openai_gpt-4_1
97,scienceagentbench,0.00,,"existence_reasoning: The transcript does not provide evidence of an intrinsic defect in the benchmark item (e.g., missing dataset files in the benchmark path, ambiguous instructions, broken evaluation, or missing libraries in the evaluation Docker). Instead, all observed failures occur inside the development sandbox tooling (python_interpreter) which is explicitly stated to lack DeepChem/TensorFlow support. That is not a benchmark defect; it is an expected limitation of the interactive sandbox versus the evaluation container. | causation_reasoning: The failure to execute is caused by using the sandbox python_interpreter, which lacks TensorFlow (and thus DeepChem). The task instructions explicitly warn that 'The development sandbox blocks these imports, but the evaluation Docker container has ... properly configured.' Therefore, a correct agent should stop trying to run DeepChem/TensorFlow in the sandbox and simply output the required code. The benchmark is solvable in the intended evaluation environment; the agent's repeated execution attempts and inability to inspect .pkl files in this sandbox do not demonstrate impossibility in the benchmark. | evidence: Sandbox execution errors: ""Error: Code execution failed at line 'import deepchem as dc' due to: ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tensorflow'"" (repeated many times, e.g., call_4/call_5/call_7 etc.).
