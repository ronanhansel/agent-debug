74,scienceagentbench,1.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The run repeatedly fails at the very first required import with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'oggm'`. Since the task explicitly requires OGGM usage and imports, a missing OGGM installation in the execution environment (or the environment used for validation/execution in this run) is a benchmark/environment defect. With OGGM unavailable, no agent can successfully execute OGGM-based code in this environment. | causation_reasoning: The failure is entirely due to the missing `oggm` module: execution stops at `import oggm` before any task logic (data access, simulation, plotting, saving) can occur. This prevents success regardless of code quality, so the defect directly caused the failure. | evidence: Multiple tool execution attempts fail identically, e.g.:
- ""Code execution failed at line 'import oggm' due to: ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'oggm'"" (call_3)
- Same error repeated for call_4, call_5, call_7, call_8, call_9, call_10, call_12, call_13, call_14, call_15, call_17, call_18, call_19, call_20, call_22, call_23, call_24, call_25, call_27, call_28, call_29, call_30, call_32, call_33, call_34, call_35, call_37.",sab_husky_openai_o4-mini_2025-04-16_high
97,scienceagentbench,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The only observed failure is due to the development sandbox (python_interpreter tool) lacking TensorFlow, which prevents importing DeepChem. The task explicitly clarifies that this sandbox blocks these imports and that the evaluation Docker container has TensorFlow/DeepChem/DGL installed. That means there is no intrinsic benchmark defect in dataset, instructions, output spec, or evaluation—this is an expected limitation of the interactive tool environment, not the benchmark item. | causation_reasoning: The run failed because the agent repeatedly attempted to execute DeepChem code inside the sandbox despite the task's clarification that such imports are blocked there. In the actual evaluation environment (where TensorFlow is present), the provided solution approach could run. Thus the failure is due to agent process/capability (ignoring environment constraints and repeatedly re-running the same failing import), not because the benchmark is unsolvable. | evidence: Task clarification: ""The development sandbox blocks these imports, but the evaluation Docker container has Python 3.10, TensorFlow 2.17, DGL, and DeepChem's CGCNN properly configured."" Repeated sandbox error: ""Code execution failed at line 'import deepchem as dc' due to: ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tensorflow'"" (e.g., call_2, call_3, call_4, call_5, call_7, call_8, call_9, call_10, call_12, call_13, call_14, call_15, call_17, call_18, call_19, call_20, call_22, call_23, call_24, call_25, call_27, call_28, call_29, call_30, call_32, call_33, call_34, call_35, call_37).",sab_husky_openai_o4-mini_2025-04-16_high
12,scienceagentbench,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The transcript shows an environment limitation: the provided python execution tool/sandbox cannot import DeepPurpose (ModuleNotFoundError). This is an execution environment issue of the interactive sandbox, but the task explicitly clarifies that the development sandbox blocks these imports while the evaluation Docker container has DeepPurpose installed. Therefore, this is not an intrinsic defect in the benchmark item; it is an expected limitation of the dev environment described by the task. | causation_reasoning: The run is marked failed because the agent repeatedly attempted to execute code in the sandbox, which predictably cannot import DeepPurpose. However, the benchmark task does not require successful execution in the sandbox—only correct final code for the evaluation container. A better agent would stop trying to run DeepPurpose in the sandbox and simply output a single Python code block as the final answer (and avoid extra tool calls / malformed wrapping like embedding code inside final_answer strings). Hence the failure is due to agent behavior rather than an intrinsic benchmark defect that would prevent any agent from succeeding in the evaluation environment. | evidence: Tool error repeated many times: ""Code execution failed at line 'from DeepPurpose import utils, dataset, DTI' due to: ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'DeepPurpose'"".
Task clarification explicitly notes this is expected: ""The development sandbox blocks these imports, but the evaluation Docker container has DeepPurpose... Write your code as if imports work."".
Agent kept retrying execution despite this: ""Now let's retry: take care not to repeat previous errors!"" followed by repeated identical import attempts.",sab_husky_openai_o4-mini_2025-04-16_high
64,scienceagentbench,1.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The run environment available to the agent (the provided python_interpreter sandbox) lacks the required OGGM package, despite the task requiring OGGM imports and execution to generate the plot. This is an execution environment mismatch: the task explicitly requires OGGM and claims it is available in the evaluation container, but the only executable environment in the transcript repeatedly raises ModuleNotFoundError for oggm, preventing any OGGM-based solution from running here. | causation_reasoning: The failure is entirely due to the missing OGGM dependency in the execution environment used during the run. The agent's code never proceeds past the first import line, so no amount of improved scientific reasoning or code changes would succeed within this environment. Therefore the benchmark/environment setup caused the failure. | evidence: Multiple tool executions fail immediately: ""Code execution failed at line 'import oggm' due to: ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'oggm'"" (call_3, call_4, call_5, call_7, call_8, call_9, call_10, call_12, call_13, call_14, call_15, call_17, call_18, call_19, call_20, call_22, call_23, call_24, call_25, call_27, call_28, call_29, call_30, call_32, call_33, call_34, call_35, call_37, call_38). The task itself asserts an environment distinction: ""The development sandbox blocks these imports, but the evaluation Docker container has OGGM 1.6.1..."" indicating a setup mismatch for interactive execution.",sab_husky_openai_o4-mini_2025-04-16_high
95,scienceagentbench,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The transcript only shows failures in the development sandbox's restricted `python_interpreter`, where importing DeepChem triggers a TensorFlow import error. The task instructions explicitly warn: ""The development sandbox blocks these imports, but the evaluation Docker container has Python 3.10, TensorFlow 2.17, and DeepChem properly configured."" Therefore, the observed import failure is not evidence of a benchmark defect in the actual evaluation setting. No dataset corruption, instruction ambiguity, evaluation bug, or environment defect in the benchmark container is demonstrated in the transcript. | causation_reasoning: The agent's run failed because it repeatedly attempted to execute DeepChem code in the sandbox tool despite the known limitation, instead of just outputting the final code (which is what the task requires). This is an agent execution/planning issue in the interactive environment, not an intrinsic benchmark impossibility. In the intended evaluation container, the same code could run given the stated availability of TensorFlow and DeepChem. | evidence: Task clarification: ""The development sandbox blocks these imports, but the evaluation Docker container has Python 3.10, TensorFlow 2.17, and DeepChem properly configured. Write your code as if imports work.""

52,scienceagentbench,1.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The task instructions state that DeepChem and TensorFlow are available in the evaluation Docker, but in the provided run environment the agent's code cannot import DeepChem because TensorFlow is missing. This indicates an execution environment mismatch (TensorFlow not installed/available), which is a benchmark/platform defect under the rubric's 'Execution Environment Issues'. | causation_reasoning: The failure occurs immediately at import time for `deepchem` due to missing `tensorflow`, preventing any progress on training, prediction, or visualization. Since the benchmark requires those imports and the environment cannot satisfy them (in this run), no agent could succeed in this environment; thus the defect directly caused the failure. | evidence: Multiple attempts fail at the same point: ""Code execution failed at line 'import deepchem as dc' due to: ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tensorflow'"" (e.g., call_7, call_8, call_9, call_10, call_12, call_13, call_14, call_15, call_17, call_18, call_19, call_20, call_22, call_23, call_24, call_25, call_27, call_28, call_29, call_30, call_32, call_33, call_34, call_35, call_37).

102,scienceagentbench,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The trace does not provide evidence of a benchmark intrinsic defect (e.g., missing/corrupt dataset, ambiguous instructions, broken evaluation). The observed errors arise from the agent repeatedly attempting to execute code in the sandbox via `python_interpreter`, which lacks MODNet by design; the task explicitly states that MODNet imports will fail in the development sandbox and should not be executed there. This is an agent execution/strategy error rather than a benchmark formation issue. | causation_reasoning: Failure was caused by the agent's misuse of the tool and output channel: it kept invoking `python_interpreter` which cannot import `modnet`, producing `ModuleNotFoundError`, and it also repeatedly attempted to wrap the final solution in triple-quoted strings passed to `final_answer(...)` inside `python_interpreter`, causing `SyntaxError: unterminated triple-quoted string literal`. A capable agent could succeed by simply outputting the required Python code in one markdown code block without executing it in the sandbox. | evidence: Task clarification: ""The development sandbox blocks these imports... Write your code as if imports work."" Repeated sandbox execution failures: ""ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'modnet'"" (e.g., call_7, call_8, call_9, call_10, call_12, call_17, call_22, call_33, etc.).
