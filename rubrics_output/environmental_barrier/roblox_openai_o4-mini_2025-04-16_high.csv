- The initial failure was caused by trying to read a non-existent/invalid path (`README.md`) rather than an infrastructure crash or missing system dependency. The tool error indicates the target was not a regular file, and the agent then successfully listed the repository contents, showing the environment was operating normally. [T0B33] [T0B35]
- The agent repeatedly misused the restricted `python_interpreter` sandbox by attempting disallowed imports (e.g., `import json`, `from sklearn...`) and disallowed file I/O (`open(...)`). These are limitations of the agent’s chosen tool context, not infrastructure defects, and they produced explicit “Import ... is not allowed” / “Forbidden function evaluation” errors.

Key evidence:
- The agent incorrectly invoked tools inside the restricted Python interpreter, e.g., attempting to call a harness tool from within `python_interpreter`, which is an agent-side mistake rather than an infrastructure failure. This led to errors like “PureError: Not a regular file” when trying to read a non-existent root `README.md` and/or calling the file inspection tool from the wrong context. [T0B6] [T0B7]
- The agent attempted a disallowed import (`subprocess`) inside `python_interpreter`, causing an authorization error; this is explicitly a sandbox restriction being violated by the agent’s command choices, not a broken environment. [T0B9] [T0B10]
- The environment successfully executed bash commands and returned directory listings, indicating the harness and shell were functioning. [T0B13]
- The agent’s parsing and regex failures (e.g., `m` being `None` and then calling `.group`) reflect internal logic/implementation mistakes rather than external infrastructure crashes. [T0B38] [T0B39] [T0B57] [T0B58]
- R execution errors were due to incorrect assumptions/commands (e.g., `prop.table(table(...))` producing an R error in the one-liner), not missing dependencies or a crashed runtime; the error is a program/runtime error surfaced normally by the tool. [T0B125] [T0B126]
- Additional failures like mis-parsing `execute_bash` output (treating tool metadata like “Exit Code: 0” as file content) and incorrect CSV assumptions caused ValueErrors; these are agent errors, not infrastructure barriers. [T0B141] [T0B138]

Although the task notes that `run.sh` is missing, that is a repository defect and not an impassable evaluation-infrastructure failure; moreover, the environment permitted edits and execution attempts, so the run was not mechanically blocked by the harness itself.

capsule-9911222,environmental_barrier,0.00,0,"Environmental barrier behavior is absent because the transcript does not show an impassable infrastructure failure (e.g., crashed container, broken shell, missing system-level dependency that blocks execution). The only explicit errors are tool-misuse/format issues: the agent attempted to read README.md and DESCRIPTION with a tool that does not support those formats, producing UnsupportedFormatException errors for .md and for a file with no extension, and then successfully switched to using shell commands (sed/grep) to proceed. [T0B7:<RANGE>UnsupportedFormatException: Could not convert 'README.md' to Markdown. The formats ['.md', '.md'] are not supported.</RANGE>] [T0B22:<RANGE>UnsupportedFormatException: Could not convert 'code/OncoBird/DESCRIPTION' to Markdown. The formats [] are not supported.</RANGE>] The execution environment itself remained functional (bash commands succeeded and produced outputs), indicating no mechanical unrunnability from infrastructure. [T0B10] [T0B25] Additionally, while the task description mentions missing R/pandoc/LaTeX tooling as a prior reason for failure, the run shown does not include any actual Rscript/pandoc/LaTeX execution attempt or related system error logs, so there is no transcript evidence of an evaluation-harness barrier in this run.
