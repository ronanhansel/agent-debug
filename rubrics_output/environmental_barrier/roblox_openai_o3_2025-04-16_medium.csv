In fact, `Rscript` was available and discoverable in the environment (`/opt/conda/bin/Rscript`).[T0B12] The key failures shown were instead due to the agent’s own tool misuse and formatting issues, such as repeatedly producing responses that did not match the required code-block parsing format, triggering “Error in code parsing” messages.[T0B6:<RANGE>Error in code parsing:

Instead, progress is blocked by the agent’s own tool misuse and formatting errors. The run repeatedly fails because the agent calls tools via `python_interpreter` in disallowed ways (e.g., attempting to import `subprocess`) and hits the tool’s import whitelist restriction, which is an agent/tool-usage error rather than an infrastructure failure [T0B9:<RANGE>Import from subprocess is not allowed. Authorized imports are: ['time', 'math', 'unicodedata', 'random', 'datetime', 'statistics', 'collections', 're', 'itertools', 'queue', 'stat']</RANGE>]. The agent also cannot read `README.md` using `inspect_file_as_text` because it is an unsupported format in this harness, but the transcript frames this as a tool limitation rather than a crash or broken environment, and the agent fails to switch to an alternative (e.g., using `execute_bash` to `cat` the file) [T0B21:<RANGE>UnsupportedFormatException: Could not convert 'code/README.md' to Markdown.

Additionally, multiple “code parsing” failures occur because the agent responds without the required code block pattern, again reflecting agent compliance/formatting mistakes rather than infrastructure failure [T0B6:<RANGE>Your code snippet is invalid, because the regex pattern ```(?:py|python)?\s*\n(.*?)\n``` was not found in it.</RANGE>]. Although the task description mentions environment restrictions (e.g., `os` disallowed, torch version incompatibility, missing checkpoint), the agent never actually reaches running `PGAT/main.py` and therefore never demonstrates an unrecoverable harness crash; the observed blockers are primarily self-inflicted tool/format misuse.",roblox_openai_o3_2025-04-16_medium
capsule-9240688,environmental_barrier,0.00,0,"The run shows tool and environment limitations, but they do not rise to an “environmental barrier” that makes the task mechanically unrunnable; the primary failures are due to the agent’s approach and tool misuse.

The environment and harness were functioning: the agent successfully executed shell commands via `execute_bash` (e.g., listing the repo tree) without any infrastructure crash or harness failure [T0B13:<RANGE>Exit Code: 0
Stdout:

results</RANGE>]. It also successfully read repository files through the provided inspection tool (e.g., `data/figure3-appendix.csv`) [T0B32].

The key blockers encountered were not infrastructure defects but (a) agent mistakes and (b) documented sandbox constraints. For example, the agent attempted an unauthorized import (`textwrap`) in `python_interpreter`, triggering a sandbox restriction error listing allowed imports, which is an internal misuse rather than an environmental crash [T0B10]. Later, the agent tried to read an `.R` file using `inspect_file_as_text`, which explicitly does not support that format, resulting in an UnsupportedFormatException—again a tool misuse rather than a broken environment [T0B99].

Although the task notes that `run.sh` is missing and certain file I/O is forbidden [T0B16:<RANGE>This task failed because:
- The repository entrypoint `run.sh` is missing.
- The sandbox forbids direct file I/O (e.g., using `open()`) and importing modules like `csv`.</RANGE>], these are known task constraints with suggested workarounds (e.g., adding a stub `run.sh`, using harness tools) rather than unexpected infrastructure defects. The transcript does not contain evidence of crashes, missing system dependencies, broken shells, or harness errors that made execution impossible; instead, it shows the agent failing to complete extraction due to not following through with available alternative methods (e.g., using `execute_bash` to view `.R` files, which eventually worked) [T0B631].",roblox_openai_o3_2025-04-16_medium
capsule-9832712,environmental_barrier,0.00,0,"Environmental barrier behavior is absent because the transcript does not show clear evidence of an infrastructure-originated failure that made the task mechanically unrunnable (e.g., Docker crash, broken shell, missing system dependency with logs, or harness/tool outage). Instead, the run repeatedly fails due to the agent not using the tools correctly and producing malformed tool-call inputs that the harness rejects. For example, when the agent tries to “Use bash find,” it does not call the bash tool and instead emits plain text, which triggers a code-parsing error from the harness about missing the required code-block pattern [T0B9]. This same formatting/tool-use error repeats many times, indicating agent misuse rather than infrastructure failure [T0B21]. Additionally, the only concrete execution error shown is from using an unauthorized Python import in the restricted `python_interpreter`, which is again an agent/tool-usage issue, not an environmental barrier [T0B159:<RANGE>InterpreterError: Import from textwrap is not allowed. Authorized imports are: ['unicodedata', 're', 'queue', 'math', 'random', 'stat', 'collections', 'itertools', 'time', 'datetime', 'statistics']</RANGE>]. While the task statement mentions that the task previously failed due to missing `Rscript` and blocked `apt-get` [T0B1], the transcript never shows the agent actually attempting the prescribed conda-based installation or running into a logged, tool-level infrastructure block (e.g., `conda` failing to run, shell disabled with a tool error). Claims that `execute_bash` is disabled appear as unsupported assertions by the agent without accompanying tool error logs [T0B155:<RANGE>the `execute_bash` tool, required for repository inspection and conda installations, is currently disabled in this environment</RANGE>]. Therefore, the failure is attributable to agent/tool misuse rather than an external, impassable evaluation-environment defect.",roblox_openai_o3_2025-04-16_medium

Core tooling was available and functional: `Rscript`, `pandoc`, and `pdflatex` were found successfully in the environment.
