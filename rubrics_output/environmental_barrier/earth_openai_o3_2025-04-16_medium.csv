capsule-9832712,environmental_barrier,0.00,0,"Environmental barrier behavior is absent because the transcript does not show an impassable infrastructure failure (e.g., crashed container, broken shell, missing system-level dependency in the harness) that mechanically prevents running commands; instead, the run is dominated by the agent’s own tool/protocol misuse and incorrect assumptions.

Key failures were due to agent mistakes and sandbox/tooling constraints rather than evaluation infrastructure breakage:
- The agent repeatedly triggered “Error in code parsing” by not providing properly formatted code blocks, indicating misuse of the interaction protocol rather than an environment crash. [T0B9] [T0B30] [T0B65]
- The agent attempted disallowed imports (e.g., `subprocess`, `textwrap`, `csv`) and received explicit tool policy errors about authorized imports; this is not a missing system dependency but a misuse of the restricted python tool. [T0B12] [T0B80] [T0B330]
- When the agent did use the shell successfully, it executed and returned outputs normally (e.g., `ls -R`, `head`), demonstrating that the environment/harness was functioning. [T0B108] [T0B301]
- The agent claimed conda/R could not be used and that the environment disallowed it, but this was not corroborated by a concrete harness crash or system error; it’s an assertion and/or a limitation of available tools rather than an infrastructure defect that made the task mechanically unrunnable. [T0B31]

Although the task description mentions prior failures involving conda ToS gates and compilation issues, these appear only in the user-provided guidance and are not evidenced as occurring during this run (no container crash logs, no missing `ft2build.h` compilation trace, no `R_getVarEx` loader error produced in the transcript).

capsule-9911222,environmental_barrier,1.00,0,"Environmental barrier behavior is present because the task was blocked by infrastructure/tooling constraints rather than solely by the agent’s reasoning. The task description itself states that conda installation was blocked by a Terms-of-Service gate (CondaToSNonInteractiveError) and that system-level tooling (`pkg-config`) was missing, preventing package compilation and thus blocking the vignette run at `library(OncoBird)`. [T0B0:<RANGE>This task failed because:
- Conda installation was blocked by CondaToSNonInteractiveError (Terms of Service not accepted for default channels).
- Compilation of OncoBird R package failed due to missing `pkg-config` system tool.
- The vignette failed when calling `library(OncoBird)` because the package was not installed correctly.</RANGE>] Additionally, the transcript shows the agent repeatedly unable to proceed due to environment limitations (e.g., inability to set up the required R/TeX/Conda toolchain) rather than a correctable code logic issue. [T0B297:<RANGE>Within this execution environment we neither have R installed nor the ability to create new Conda environments with conda-forge/bioconda (the sandbox blocks external downloads and large package installs, e.g. texlive-core).</RANGE>] While the agent also made many tool-usage mistakes (e.g., disallowed imports and malformed tool calls), the underlying blockers described above constitute an external infrastructure barrier that prevents successful completion.",earth_openai_o3_2025-04-16_medium
