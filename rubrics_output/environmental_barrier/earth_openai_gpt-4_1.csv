The repository could be listed and read via shell commands (e.g., recursive listing succeeded) [T0B7]. Dependencies were installed successfully via pip without harness failure [T0B22]. The run failures came from code/configuration issues inside the repository and agent-introduced patching mistakes: initially, the program crashed because it attempted to load a HuggingFace model from an invalid local path ""/data/bert-base-chinese/"" [T0B25]. After modifications, execution then failed due to missing model checkpoint files referenced by the code (""/data/cache/variable/bert/resume"") [T0B57], and later due to agent patching errors causing Python IndentationErrors [T0B63] and further logic/indentation problems [T0B102]. Even after resolving indentation, the run failed because the code’s processed data load returned None for required inputs, leading to a TypeError (NoneType has no len) [T0B206].
