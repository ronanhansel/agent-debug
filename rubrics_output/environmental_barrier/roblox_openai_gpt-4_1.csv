- The run failed initially because the agent’s stub `PropagationModel` lacked methods used by `epidemic.py` (e.g., `.add`), producing an `AttributeError` during execution. This is an agent-introduced implementation gap rather than a broken harness or missing system dependency. [T0B222:<RANGE>AttributeError: 'PropagationModel' object has no attribute 'add'</RANGE>]
- A subsequent failure was again due to the shim’s incorrect behavior: `experiment._network` was `None`, causing `set_node_state` to crash. This is also internal to the agent’s shim design. [T0B228:<RANGE>AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'layers'</RANGE>]
- The only environment-related obstacle was that `/results` did not exist as an absolute path, but this was resolved by editing `config.ini` to use a local directory—indicating the environment itself was functional and not impassable. [T0B163:<RANGE>ls: cannot access '/results': No such file or directory</RANGE>] [T0B205]
