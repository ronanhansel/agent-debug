Although the agent later claimed that rendering/installation would exceed resource limits and that it could not run commands [T0B29] [T0B63] [T0B107], the transcript does not contain any concrete infrastructure error logs (e.g., Docker crash, apt failure, missing system dependency) showing the task was mechanically unrunnable; instead, the only concrete errors are the parser-format errors and unauthorized-import errors, both attributable to the agent [T0B6] [T0B9] [T0B12].",corebench_hard_hal_generalist_agento3medium_1755626315_UPLOAD
