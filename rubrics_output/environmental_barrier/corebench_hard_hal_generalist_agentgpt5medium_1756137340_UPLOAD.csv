Rscript not found</RANGE>]. The environment also lacked the LaTeX toolchain needed to compile a PDF: both latexmk and pdflatex were missing [T0B13:<RANGE>latexmk not found</RANGE>] [T0B13:<RANGE>pdflatex not found</RANGE>]. These are infrastructure/runtime prerequisites rather than agent logic errors, and they make the required ""run Rscript and render it as a pdf"" mechanically unrunnable in the provided setup.

Although the agent also made some tool-usage mistakes (e.g., using disallowed Python imports like pathlib/os/subprocess/typing) [T0B7:<RANGE>Import from pathlib is not allowed.</RANGE>] [T0B10:<RANGE>Import of os is not allowed.</RANGE>] [T0B17:<RANGE>Import from subprocess is not allowed.</RANGE>] [T0B28:<RANGE>Import from typing is not allowed.</RANGE>], those did not cause the core blockage. The core inability to execute the required Rscript render step stems from missing R/LaTeX in the environment, which prevented the mandated evaluation procedure from being carried out.",corebench_hard_hal_generalist_agentgpt5medium_1756137340_UPLOAD
