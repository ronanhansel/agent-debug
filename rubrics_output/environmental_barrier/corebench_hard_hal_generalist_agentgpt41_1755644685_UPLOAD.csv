Instead, it was caused by unmet or incompatible Python-level dependencies in the repository/task setup. The agent successfully executed shell commands and pip installs (e.g., installing requirements) without infrastructure failure, indicating the environment was functional.[T0B79] The initial execution of the target script failed due to a missing Python package (`ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'networkx'`), which is a dependency/configuration issue rather than an impassable harness problem.[T0B82] After installing `networkx`, running the script failed due to missing `network_diffusion`.[T0B119] The agent then installed a similarly named package, but the script still failed because the installed package did not provide the required API (`ImportError: cannot import name 'MultiSpreading' from 'network_diffusion'`).[T0B174] Even after additional attempts (uninstalling/reinstalling), the same incompatibility remained and the script could not run.[T0B315] These errors stem from the repository’s dependency/API mismatch (internal to the task/code), not from an external infrastructure defect that made the task mechanically unrunnable.",corebench_hard_hal_generalist_agentgpt41_1755644685_UPLOAD

capsule-9137200,environmental_barrier,1.00,0,"Environmental barrier behavior is present because the run becomes mechanically unrunnable due to evaluation-environment constraints rather than agent logic.

Second, the repository’s stated requirements (Python 3.8 + torch 1.7.1) cannot be satisfied in the provided environment (Python 3.12), with pip reporting no matching distribution for torch==1.7.1; this is a dependency/harness mismatch that blocks faithful execution [T0B72:<RANGE>ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement torch==1.7.1+cpu</RANGE></RANGE>] [T0B72:<RANGE>ERROR: No matching distribution found for torch==1.7.1</RANGE>].
