This is an intrinsic benchmark/tooling formation defect: the benchmark asks for raw HTML wrapped in <html>, but the parser rejects it unless it is embedded inside a python-marked code fence, which is unrelated to the task requirements. | causation_reasoning: The agent's attempts to provide the required HTML were blocked by the benchmark's parser, producing repeated 'Error in code parsing' messages. This prevented normal progression using the intended HTML output format. The agent only proceeded by wrapping HTML in a python-fenced block and calling tools inside that block, which is a workaround for the broken parser, not a capability issue.
