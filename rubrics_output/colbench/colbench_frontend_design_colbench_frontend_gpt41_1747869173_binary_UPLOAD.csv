This breaks the feedback channel required by the benchmark design, leaving the agent unable to obtain the necessary visual differences that the evaluation (CLIP similarity vs a specific ground-truth design) implicitly demands. | causation_reasoning: Because the simulated user could not provide any concrete differences between the agent’s design and the hidden ground-truth design, the agent had no way to steer toward the exact target layout/colors/typography.

This indicates the user simulator/tooling is not correctly executing the ask_user interaction loop for this item, preventing normal information exchange and feedback-based iteration required by the benchmark design. | causation_reasoning: This defect prevented the agent from receiving any actionable feedback or requirements beyond the generic prompt, and even prevented normal Q&A (ask_user) from working as intended. The agent attempted to ask questions twice; both times the interaction returned an irrelevant refusal about image description.

This suggests the simulated user (or the image comparison pipeline feeding it) is not reliably seeing/processing the agent's submitted visualization, leading to incorrect guidance unrelated to agent capability. | causation_reasoning: Because the simulated user incorrectly reported that the agent's visualization was missing and later that the left-side video placeholder was missing (despite it being present in the rendered HTML), the agent could not obtain accurate comparative feedback to converge to the ground-truth design.

Because the only allowed way to get pixel-level guidance is via that rendered snippet, and the tool cannot accept it, the benchmark formation prevents normal completion of the collaborative loop. | causation_reasoning: The failure is directly caused by the ask_user tool error when attempting to submit the required HTML snippet. The agent made two attempts to call ask_user with the <html> snippet and both failed with the same TypeError.

Additionally, the ask_user tool invocation fails with a TypeError, indicating an evaluation/tooling environment defect that prevents further dialogue even when the agent tries to comply with the one-preview feedback loop. | causation_reasoning: The run failed because the agent could not obtain any actionable preferences or requirements from the user (all responses were irrelevant to the questions) and then could not even solicit feedback on the provided preview due to the ask_user tool crashing (TypeError).
