This indicates an information extraction failure from code to answerable facts, making the collaboration channel unable to convey the true spec. | causation_reasoning: This defect caused the failure because, without the hidden rule being communicated, an agent cannot infer the required conditional logic and constants from the task description alone. The agent consequently invented a default category-based funding policy unrelated to the hidden solution. Any agent relying on the simulated user would face the same ""I don't know"" responses, preventing recovery of the actual benchmarked behavior, so passing the test cases would be impossible via dialogue. | evidence: Hidden solution (provided to simulated user): ""if event_type in ['colloquia', 'research'] and 'peace' in proposal_details['theme'].lower() and 'justice' in proposal_details['theme'].lower() and float(budget['total_cost']) > 1000 and speaker_fees in ['moderate', 'high'] and 'Princeton' in student_organization: ... return 500 ... else return 250 ... else return 0"".

545,colbench,1.00,,"existence_reasoning: The benchmark’s hidden information encodes a very specific expected implementation that does not match the natural-language task, and the simulated user is constrained to only reveal what is in hidden info. The hidden code indicates the function should simply include players whose name is contained in the `facial_hair` input and return {'players': [{'name', 'games_played'}, ...]}. This is an arbitrary and non-inferable requirement relative to the prompt (which talks about “mustache or beard style” and “how well each footballer did”). Moreover, because the hidden info provides only code (no explicit natural-language schema/requirements for `facial_hair`), the simulated user cannot provide clarifying details beyond minimal keys, repeatedly answering “I don’t know,” which blocks any agent from deriving the exact expected behavior from dialogue alone. | causation_reasoning: This defect would cause evaluation failure for an otherwise reasonable agent: the agent attempted to resolve ambiguity by proposing a plausible schema with facial hair styles and per-match stats, but the benchmark’s expected solution (per hidden info) actually ignores facial-hair styles and match stats entirely and instead checks `if player['name'] in facial_hair`. Since the user cannot reveal additional constraints beyond the hidden code, no agent could reliably infer that `facial_hair` is (apparently) a collection of player names rather than a beard/mustache style, nor that the output must be wrapped as {'players': [...]} with only name and games_played. Thus the mismatch between task description and hidden expected behavior (plus the user’s inability to communicate it) is what would drive failing test cases, not an agent capability limitation. | evidence: Hidden information provided to the simulated user: ""def get_player_stats(team_roster, facial_hair):\n  stats = {'players': []}\n  for player in team_roster:\n    if player['name'] in facial_hair:\n      player_stats = {'name': player['name'], 'games_played': player['games_played']}\n      stats['players'].append(player_stats)\n  return stats"". Simulated user repeatedly cannot provide required schema/metrics: ""I don't know if there are other keys..."" and ""I don't have an example... I only know that each player dict includes 'name' and 'games_played'."" The task text claims facial hair style drives performance: ""find out how well each footballer did given their mustache or beard style during their match"", which conflicts with hidden expected behavior using player name membership in `facial_hair`.",colbench_backend_programming_colbench_o4minihigh_1747802893_UPLOAD

This matches the rubric's 'Simulated User Response Issues: Information Extraction Failure' pattern. | causation_reasoning: This run did not fail (agent_run metadata: ""failed"": false), so the benchmark defect did not cause a failure here. However, the agent's final logic materially differs from the hidden intended logic (it invents a mapping, waiting periods, and a 1-year reduction rather than the simple rule in hidden code).

147,colbench,0.00,,"existence_reasoning: A benchmark formation defect exists: the simulated user is instructed to answer in exactly two sentences, and repeatedly appends the meta-statement ""If the answer is not found in the hidden information, I don't know."" This breaks normal tool assumptions (string return) and even caused a type/formatting mismatch where the tool output appeared as a tuple, producing a parsing error. This is a simulated-user response issue (information extraction / response-format failure), since the hidden info contains clean values but the user wrapper injects extra text and possibly extra structure. | causation_reasoning: Despite the defect, it did not cause failure in this run: the agent implemented robust parsing (handling tuple vs string and trimming at the first period) and successfully gathered all needed facts, then produced a final function. The run metadata shows ""failed"": false, so there is no task failure to attribute to the benchmark defect. | evidence: User responses included extra mandated text: ""Linux, Windows, MacOS. If the answer is not found in the hidden information, I don't know."" Tool error: ""Object (..., 'You may still continue to work on the task') has no attribute split"". Agent workaround: ""# Handle tuple or string response"" and ""Keep only text before the first period"".

601,colbench,0.00,,"existence_reasoning: A formation defect exists: the simulated user is constrained to answer only from hidden information, but the hidden information is only a one-line function body `return total_disk_space - (windows_partition_size + linux_partition_size + recovery_partition_size)` and contains no natural-language details about units, return type, validation behavior, or per-OS breakdown. As a result, when the agent asks reasonable clarifying questions (units, semantics, recovery handling, validation), the simulated user must respond ""I don't know"" even though real users would have preferences. This matches rubric category 1a (Information Extraction Failure) / 1c (Insufficient Detail) due to hidden info being code-only and under-specified for the dialogue questions. | causation_reasoning: This deficiency did not cause a failure in this run. The run is marked `failed: false`, and the agent produced a coherent function. Therefore, even though the simulated user was unable to provide many clarifications from hidden info, the agent still completed successfully, so no benchmark-caused failure occurred. | evidence: Hidden info shown to simulated user: `def calculate_available_disk_space(total_disk_space, windows_partition_size, linux_partition_size, recovery_partition_size): return total_disk_space - (windows_partition_size + linux_partition_size + recovery_partition_size)`.
Simulated user inability to answer clarification questions: ""I don't know the specific unit for disk space measurements. Could you help me with that?"" and ""I don't know the specific details about whether the parameters represent capacity or used space."" and ""I don't know the specific details about how the recovery partition should factor into the available-space calculation for each OS."".

80,colbench,0.00,,"existence_reasoning: A benchmark formation defect exists: the simulated user responses are inconsistent with the hidden reference implementation about the required input schema for `people_data` and `preferences`. The hidden info shows `people_data` is a dict mapping `person -> details` and `preferences` is also a dict mapping `person -> preference` (both keyed by person name), while the simulated user told the agent `people_data` is a list of dicts containing a 'name' field, and also gave conflicting descriptions of whether `preferences` is keyed by categories or by person names. This is an intrinsic simulated-user issue (inconsistent/varying schema descriptions) because it can mislead an agent away from the actual expected function interface and behavior. | causation_reasoning: The run did not fail (agent_run metadata shows failed=false). Therefore, even though an intrinsic defect exists (schema inconsistency), it did not cause a failure in this transcript. Under the rubric, Score 1 requires the defect to have caused failure/impossibility; here there is no failure to attribute. | evidence: Hidden info reference code: ""for person, details in people_data.items():"" and ""for person, preference in preferences.items():"" (both are dicts keyed by person).
Simulated user to agent: ""Each person in people_data has keys like 'hair_color' and 'eye_color', which are strings."" and later ""Each person in `people_data` is identified by their name"" (implying list of dicts with 'name').
Simulated user inconsistency about preferences: ""preferences argument includes keys for each person"" vs earlier agent understanding that preferences keys correspond to categories; agent explicitly notes conflict: ""There is a conflict between earlier mapping rules for categories ... and the current description of `preferences` as personal profiles keyed by person names.""
