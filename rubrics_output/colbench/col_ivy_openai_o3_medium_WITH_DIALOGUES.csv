1,colbench,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The task specification and simulated user responses are clear, consistent, and fully determine the expected boolean logic for all three entity values. There are no hidden arbitrary constants, missing edge-case requirements, contradictory instructions, or evaluation-mismatch signals in the transcript. The problem is straightforward and solvable within the dialogue constraints. | causation_reasoning: Since the user provided complete rules for each entity/condition combination, any failure is not attributable to an intrinsic benchmark defect. A competent agent can implement the described conditional logic directly. The agent’s proposed implementation appears aligned with the stated rules, so the recorded failure would more likely be due to agent-side issues (e.g., formatting/packaging for the harness, incorrect entity normalization expectations, or other capability/integration mistakes), not an IFE. | evidence: User provides explicit rules: ""Lance is willing to testify for 'USADA' only if there are criminal charges and the deadline is met. For 'truth and reconciliation commission', he is willing if the deadline is met, and for 'Oprah Winfrey', he is never willing.""

15,colbench,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The task is a straightforward total computation given two sequences: sum(tip_amounts[i] * individuals_tipped[i]). The transcript does not show any intrinsic benchmark defect such as contradictory simulated-user info, hidden magic constants, or evaluation mismatches. The user’s uncertainty about whether the lists are parallel/what to do on length mismatch is a normal under-specification that an agent can resolve by choosing a reasonable convention (e.g., require equal lengths, or zip to shorter) consistent with typical coding tasks; nothing indicates tests require an unknowable arbitrary choice. | causation_reasoning: The failure is attributable to the agent not producing a final answer in the expected format. The assistant ends with 'I WANT TO ANSWER:' and a code block, indicating it may not have emitted the final function in the required way for the harness. The agent also spent multiple turns trying to elicit preferences instead of committing to a reasonable default earlier; this is a dialogue strategy/capability issue, not an intrinsic formation error that would prevent any agent from succeeding. | evidence: User repeatedly cannot specify list alignment/length handling: ""I don't know if `tip_amounts` and `individuals_tipped` are parallel lists..."" and ""I don't know what the function should do if the two lists are of different lengths.""

16,colbench,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The task as stated is straightforward and sufficiently specified after the single clarification: compute the absolute emissions cut amount as a percentage of current annual emissions. The simulated user provided clear answers (total absolute amount only; current_emissions already per-year). There is no indication of hidden arbitrary constants, complex conditional logic, contradictory user feedback, or evaluation mismatch in the transcript. | causation_reasoning: Because no intrinsic benchmark defect is evidenced in the dialogue, the failure is best attributed to agent-side issues (e.g., implementation not matching the benchmark's expected behavior/edge cases) rather than an impossibility created by the benchmark formation. The agent had enough information to implement a reasonable solution, and nothing in the interaction suggests the user withheld critical details that would make success impossible for any agent. | evidence: User clarifies requirements: ""I just want the total absolute amount to cut by the target year. The current_emissions numbers I’ll pass in are already per-year values.""

20,colbench,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: From the transcript, the user provided sufficient and consistent requirements to implement a solvable parsing function: explicit sentiment labels (like/hate), a simple pattern, and an explicit nesting order (leader → location → organization → sentiment). There is no indication of missing hidden constants, contradictory simulated-user guidance, or an underspecified evaluation-only behavior. This appears to be a standard, well-formed backend parsing task based on simple regex/token parsing. | causation_reasoning: Because the requirements were clarified by the user, any failure is more likely due to agent implementation choices that may not match the benchmark's expected normalization/output formatting (e.g., title-casing leader/org/location causing mismatches like ""the US"" becoming ""The Us""), handling of optional articles (""the US""), punctuation, multi-word entities, or whether to skip/raise on non-matching lines. A stronger agent could adjust normalization rules to preserve original casing or implement more robust entity extraction consistent with tests. Nothing in the dialogue suggests an intrinsic impossibility. | evidence: User provides explicit constraints: ""the sentiment labels should include \""like\"" and \""hate\"""" and later ""1=leader→location→organization→sentiment; 2=simple pattern; 3=only like|hate"".

22,colbench,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The task is straightforward mapping behavior. The simulated user provided all required mappings, clarified case-insensitivity, disallowed phrasing variations, and specified the fallback string for unknown characters. There is no sign of missing/hidden arbitrary constants, ambiguous requirements, inconsistent user feedback, or evaluation mismatch in the transcript. | causation_reasoning: Failure is attributable to the agent's implementation: it omitted one of the requested characters/mappings. The user listed eight characters including ""Glinda"" and ""the Good Witch of the North"" as separate entries, but the agent only implemented ""glinda, the good witch of the north"" as a single key, leaving at least one required mapping unhandled. A better agent could succeed by including exact keys for each specified character name. | evidence: User: ""The characters are Wicked Witch of the West, Glinda, the Good Witch of the North, Scarecrow, Tin Man, Cowardly Lion, Emerald City guard, and Munchkin.""

The simulated user provided the needed details consistently and unambiguously (structure of ad_type and treatment of ad_duration). There is no sign of missing hidden constants, contradictory instructions, or underspecified edge cases in the transcript. | causation_reasoning: Since no intrinsic benchmark defect is evidenced in the transcript, the failure is not attributable to an IFE. The agent produced a straightforward implementation matching the stated formula; therefore the recorded failure likely stems from agent-side output formatting/protocol issues (e.g., including extraneous text like 'I WANT TO ANSWER:' or markdown fences) or from implementation details not shown in the transcript (e.g., evaluator expecting a bare function without surrounding text). These are not intrinsic formation errors under the rubric. | evidence: User specifies: ""I want the formula to include num_ads, ad_type['revenue_per_ad'], clicks_per_ad, ad_duration, click_revenue, and ad_display_probability, all multiplied together.""

There is no sign of missing/hidden arbitrary requirements, inconsistent simulated-user feedback, or evaluation ambiguity inherent to the benchmark item based on the provided transcript. | causation_reasoning: The failure is not attributable to an intrinsic formation error in the benchmark. The agent produced a correct stable descending sort implementation using Python's stable sorted() with reverse=True and key r[2]. If the benchmark marked this as failed, it is more consistent with an external issue not evidenced here (e.g., the agent output format not being accepted, or a mismatch between what the evaluator expects and what the agent returned), but the transcript itself does not demonstrate an unavoidable benchmark defect that would prevent any agent from succeeding. | evidence: User clarifies: ""I want the reviews sorted in descending order, from highest rated to lowest. The reviews are in the format: (game_name, review_text, rating)."" User tie-break rule: ""If two games share the same rating, keep their original order.""

The agent produced a reasonable implementation matching the stated requirements. Since no benchmark formation issue is evidenced, the failure (as marked by the run metadata) would more likely stem from agent-side mismatch with unseen test expectations (e.g., handling of input structure) or other non-transcript factors rather than an IFE demonstrated here. | evidence: User provides required clarifications: ""The song durations are stored in seconds.

The simulated user provided unambiguous interpretations for the surcharge (amount, not rate), how to count blocks (integer part only), the return value (total tax), and that salary_cap can be ignored. There is no indication of hidden arbitrary constants, contradictory requirements, or evaluation mismatches in the transcript. | causation_reasoning: The agent’s final proposed implementation matches the clarified requirements, so any failure would not be attributable to an intrinsic benchmark defect. If the benchmark marked this run as failed, it is more likely due to agent-side issues outside the transcript (e.g., not actually submitting code in the required final channel/format, or a minor implementation mismatch not evidenced here), rather than an IFE that would prevent any agent from succeeding. | evidence: User clarifications: ""use a flat 15% tax rate on the excess salary""; ""For repeat offenders, add an additional surcharge: for each complete $5,000,000 of excess salary, add $0.05 to the tax.""

There is no ambiguity, missing hidden information, inconsistent simulated user behavior, or evaluation mismatch evidenced in the transcript. A competent agent can implement the required function directly from the prompt. | causation_reasoning: The agent’s produced function matches the stated formula and signature, so the benchmark failure is unlikely to be caused by an intrinsic formation defect. If the run is marked failed, it is more plausibly due to agent-side issues such as formatting/output protocol (e.g., including extra text like 'I WANT TO ANSWER:' or code fences when the evaluator expects raw code), or other execution/extraction constraints not attributable to the benchmark item itself. | evidence: Prompt gives exact requirements: ""Note: Despite the function name, calculate a weighted yards TOTAL (not a per-game average)."" and ""The formula is: (total_rushing_yards * read_option_percentage / 100) + total_passing_yards"" and ""The total_offensive_plays parameter is not used in the calculation.""

The agent asked clarifying questions and received direct, actionable answers. No evidence of hidden arbitrary constants, missing requirements, inconsistent simulated-user feedback, or evaluation mismatch appears in the transcript. | causation_reasoning: Since the dialogue provides the key edge-case decisions (mirror must exist; include both when present), a competent agent could implement a correct solution. The failure therefore is not attributable to an intrinsic benchmark formation defect; it must stem from agent-side issues (e.g., implementation details not shown in the transcript, formatting/packaging requirements of the benchmark harness, or other agent execution problems), not from missing/impossible-to-obtain information. | evidence: User clarifications define the exact rule: ""axes are represented as integer indices into the coordinate tuple"" and ""The symmetry test involves negating the coordinate at the specified axis index"".

The simulated user repeatedly responds ""I don't know"" to direct clarification questions, leaving the requirement underdetermined. If the hidden tests expect a specific choice (e.g., raise KeyError) then the benchmark is effectively checking undocumented behavior. | causation_reasoning: The agent made a reasonable but arbitrary choice to skip rows missing the column and to allow `None` as a key. If the evaluator expected the opposite (raise on missing key and/or special handling of `None`), the agent would fail despite following all provided actionable requirements. Because the user could not supply the missing specification and the prompt does not define it, no agent can reliably guarantee passing hidden tests across these edge cases. | evidence: User uncertainty on critical behavior: ""If a row is missing the specified `column`, should it be skipped or cause an error?"" -> ""If a row is missing the specified `column`, I don't know.""

There is no intrinsic ambiguity or missing hidden constants required to pass; an agent can implement exactly what is stated without needing additional hidden information. | causation_reasoning: The failure is not attributable to any benchmark formation defect. The agent unnecessarily asked for clarifications that were already present, then introduced extra behaviors not specified (e.g., coercing years_experience via int(years_experience or 0), handling invalid sales, allowing releases/awards to be None). If the test suite expects strict adherence to the stated formula without added assumptions or type coercions, these agent-added choices could cause mismatch.

98,colbench,1.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The task specification provides only qualitative relationships (older trains reduce rating; track condition 1-10; incidents count) but does not define the required scoring formula, weights, normalization (e.g., max age), or incident penalty curve. This makes the expected implementation inherently underdetermined: many distinct functions satisfy the described intent yet will differ on exact numeric outputs. If the benchmark’s hidden reference solution/test cases encode specific weights/constants/thresholds, those are effectively arbitrary from the user-visible spec and cannot be uniquely inferred via dialogue, indicating an intrinsic formation defect (Category 2a/2c and 4a). | causation_reasoning: The simulated user explicitly cannot provide the missing critical constants and instead approves the agent’s arbitrary proposal. If the evaluation expects a particular formula/constants (as backend tests typically do), the agent’s reasonable but non-matching assumptions will fail. Because the missing details are not recoverable from the spec and the user cannot supply them, no agent could reliably match the hidden expected implementation; thus the deficiency directly causes the failure. | evidence: User cannot specify required parameters: ""I don't know the maximum expected train age. ... I don't know the weight percentages or the exact penalty calculation for incidents."" User then endorses arbitrary assumptions: ""your proposal sounds reasonable to me.
