This is an environmental barrier because the task instructions forbid using `apt-get` (the typical way to install system build dependencies) and the missing system dependency prevents successful installation of required R packages and thus blocks rendering.

Key evidence:
- The agent incorrectly invoked tools inside the restricted Python interpreter, e.g., attempting to call a harness tool from within `python_interpreter`, which is an agent-side mistake rather than an infrastructure failure. This led to errors like “PureError: Not a regular file” when trying to read a non-existent root `README.md` and/or calling the file inspection tool from the wrong context. [T0B6] [T0B7]
- The agent attempted a disallowed import (`subprocess`) inside `python_interpreter`, causing an authorization error; this is explicitly a sandbox restriction being violated by the agent’s command choices, not a broken environment. [T0B9] [T0B10]
- The environment successfully executed bash commands and returned directory listings, indicating the harness and shell were functioning. [T0B13]
- The agent’s parsing and regex failures (e.g., `m` being `None` and then calling `.group`) reflect internal logic/implementation mistakes rather than external infrastructure crashes. [T0B38] [T0B39] [T0B57] [T0B58]
- R execution errors were due to incorrect assumptions/commands (e.g., `prop.table(table(...))` producing an R error in the one-liner), not missing dependencies or a crashed runtime; the error is a program/runtime error surfaced normally by the tool. [T0B125] [T0B126]
- Additional failures like mis-parsing `execute_bash` output (treating tool metadata like “Exit Code: 0” as file content) and incorrect CSV assumptions caused ValueErrors; these are agent errors, not infrastructure barriers. [T0B141] [T0B138]
