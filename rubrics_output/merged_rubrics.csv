Finally, the R pipeline failure was due to missing project files/paths (e.g., `01_scopus-selection/01_sampling.R` not found) rather than broken infrastructure. [T0B37:<RANGE>cannot open file '01_scopus-selection/01_sampling.R': No such file or directory</RANGE>]

Overall, the environment remained functional (shell commands executed, conda installs succeeded with proper configuration, and Rscript existed), and the remaining blockers stemmed from agent mistakes and repository/path issues rather than a mechanically unrunnable evaluation harness.",earth_openai_o4-mini_2025-04-16_low,rubrics_output/environmental_barrier/earth_openai_o4-mini_2025-04-16_low.csv
capsule-9911222,environmental_barrier,0.00,0,"The transcript does not show an infrastructure-level failure (e.g., crashed container, broken shell, missing system-level dependency in the harness) that makes the task mechanically unrunnable. The only explicit error is a formatting/parsing issue caused by the agent using an invalid code-block pattern (bash block instead of the required python pattern), which is an agent/tool-usage mistake rather than an environment barrier [T0B6:<RANGE>Error in code parsing:
Your code snippet is invalid, because the regex pattern ```(?:py|python)?\s*\n(.*?)\n``` was not found in it.</RANGE>]. After correcting the code-block format, the shell tooling works normally: directory listing and file reads succeed (e.g., recursive ls, sed/grep) [T0B12] [T0B26] [T0B31]. The observed 'No such file or directory' messages were due to initially incorrect paths assumed by the agent, not missing infrastructure components [T0B9:<RANGE>head: cannot open 'OncoBird/DESCRIPTION' for reading: No such file or directory

No evidence appears of conda ToS blocking, missing pkg-config, or Docker/container crashes during this run; instead, the agent successfully accessed repository files and extracted the needed data from an existing metadata file [T0B69].",earth_openai_o4-mini_2025-04-16_low,rubrics_output/environmental_barrier/earth_openai_o4-mini_2025-04-16_low.csv
