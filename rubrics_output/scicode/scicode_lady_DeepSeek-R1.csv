12,scicode,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The benchmark input provides no actual code or function signature to transform—only two comment lines stating an error (""This method must be implemented in child classes"") and a request to implement a function. Given the system instruction to ""Do NOT add or change any functionality"" and to return ""ONLY one python function"", the task is intrinsically underspecified: there is no way to know what function name/args/behavior is required, nor any source code to sanitize. Any produced function would necessarily be invented rather than extracted/cleaned, making the task ill-formed as a deterministic transformation problem. | causation_reasoning: Despite the underspecification, the agent's run fails due to agent-side noncompliance with the required output format (must be exactly one python function; no classes; remove comments). The agent output includes multiple responses with comments inside functions and even a class definition, directly violating the system constraints. These are capability/obedience issues that would cause failure even if the prompt were well-specified. | evidence: Underspecified input: user provides only ""# Error occurred: This method must be implemented in child classes\n# Please implement the required function manually"" with no code/function signature.
Agent noncompliance: outputs a function containing comments: ""def my_function():\n    # Error occurred: ..."" and also outputs a class: ""class ExampleClass:\n    def required_function(self): ..."" even though system says ""Your response should ONLY consist of one python function"" and ""Remove any comments"".",scicode_lady_DeepSeek-R1
2,scicode,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The benchmark instructions are clear: return a single Python function with no imports and no extra text. The user content provides only an error message indicating an abstract method needs an implementation, but does not specify any required signature, behavior, or context. This is not a benchmark formation deficiency in the sense of contradictory templates or impossible environment constraints; rather, the agent was expected to implement the required function meaningfully, but chose to preserve the NotImplementedError. The task appears solvable if the intended function specification were present; here, the absence of specification is in the provided user content, but the trace does not demonstrate that the benchmark itself promised more context or that the evaluation harness is misaligned. | causation_reasoning: The agent failed because it did not implement the required method and instead returned a function that still raises NotImplementedError, directly contradicting the user request to ""implement the required function manually."" This is an agent-side failure (non-implementation), not something that would block any capable agent given adequate context. | evidence: User: ""# Error occurred: This method must be implemented in child classes\n# Please implement the required function manually"". Agent output: ""def required_function():\n    raise NotImplementedError(\""This method must be implemented in child classes\"")"" which leaves the method unimplemented.",scicode_lady_DeepSeek-R1
28,scicode,1.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The benchmark input provides no actual code to transform and does not specify the required function name/signature beyond a generic error string. The system instruction says the tool ""receives a block of text and python code and returns only a python function"" and also ""Do NOT add or change any functionality inside the functions,"" but the user input contains only an error message: there is no function definition to extract or preserve. This makes it impossible for any agent to reliably produce the uniquely expected function (name, args, body) because those details are not present. | causation_reasoning: The agent failed because it had to guess a function name and implementation (first `get_user_input`, then `required_function`) in the absence of any provided source code or specification. If the benchmark had included the original code snippet (or at least the required method signature/name), a capable agent could return the correct single function. As-is, any agent output is effectively arbitrary and likely to mismatch the hidden expectation, so the deficiency is the proximate cause of failure. | evidence: User input contains only: ""# Error occurred: This method must be implemented in child classes\n# Please implement the required function manually"" with no code/function signature. System requires: ""receives a block of text and python code and returns only a python function"" and ""Do NOT add or change any functionality inside the functions."" Agent had to invent: `def get_user_input(): ...` then `def required_function(): ...`.",scicode_lady_DeepSeek-R1
35,scicode,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The task instructions are internally consistent: the agent is told to output exactly one valid Python function in a ```python code block, stripping imports and extraneous text. There is no contradiction or impossible requirement in the benchmark materials themselves. The user-provided content contains no actual function to extract, but that is an input the agent could still handle by producing a minimal valid function (or by commenting non-syntax lines per instructions). This is not a benchmark deficiency; it's simply an underspecified user input that the agent is expected to resolve while still complying with output-format constraints. | causation_reasoning: The failure is attributable to the agent not producing the required output format/function at all (it only produced multi-paragraph reasoning). Nothing in the benchmark prevented compliance; the agent could have returned a single function (e.g., a stub with pass) wrapped in a python code fence. Thus, no intrinsic deficiency caused the failure. | evidence: System instruction: ""Your response should ONLY consist of one python function... Your response should be in the format of ```python ```."" Agent messages contain only reasoning and no code/function output; e.g., the last assistant turn ends with: ""Given the ambiguity, the safest approach is to return a function with a pass statement..."" but does not actually output any function.",scicode_lady_DeepSeek-R1
52,scicode,1.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The benchmark input provides no actual python code or function signature to transform—only two comment lines describing an error. Given the system instruction to ""receive a block of text and python code and return only a python function"" and ""Do NOT add or change any functionality"", the task is structurally under-specified: there is no source function to extract/clean, no required name/arguments, and no described intended behavior beyond a generic error message. This would impede any agent because there is insufficient information to deterministically produce the single correct function expected by an evaluator. | causation_reasoning: The agent failed because the task lacks the necessary inputs (function name/signature/body) to produce a verifiable correct output. Any attempt would be a guess (e.g., inventing `def required_function(): ...`), which an automated grader would likely mark incorrect. Thus the intrinsic under-specification is the proximate cause of failure rather than an agent implementation mistake. | evidence: User provided only: ""# Error occurred: This method must be implemented in child classes\n# Please implement the required function manually"" with no code/function signature.

58,scicode,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The benchmark input provides no actual code to sanitize or concrete function specification—only two comment lines describing an error (""This method must be implemented in child classes"" and ""Please implement the required function manually""). Given the system instruction to ""not add or change any functionality inside the functions"" and to output ""ONLY ... one python function"", there is insufficient information to determine the correct function name, signature, or intended behavior. This is an intrinsic underspecification/missing-context issue in the task formation. | causation_reasoning: Despite the underspecification, the agent's failure is not shown to be caused by the benchmark deficiency. The agent produced multiple inconsistent functions (raising NotImplementedError, then pass, then a different signature with self/data still raising NotImplementedError). The run is marked failed, but the trace does not show an evaluator error indicating impossibility; rather, it indicates the agent did not converge on a correct required implementation. Thus, the proximate cause appears to be agent-side guessing/inconsistent implementation rather than a demonstrated hard block from the benchmark. | evidence: User input contains only: ""# Error occurred: This method must be implemented in child classes\n# Please implement the required function manually"" with no code/template. Agent outputs vary: ""def required_function(): raise NotImplementedError(...)"" then ""def required_function(): pass"" then ""def process_data(self, data): raise NotImplementedError(...)"".

63,scicode,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The task instructions are coherent: output exactly one Python function in a ```python``` code block, with no imports/dependencies and no extra non-function code. There is no contradiction or impossible requirement in the benchmark scaffolding itself. The user input is minimal (only an error message), but that does not create a benchmark formation deficiency; it simply provides little content to transform. | causation_reasoning: The agent failed due to not producing a compliant final answer: after one attempt (a function that still raises NotImplementedError and includes inline comments), the agent continued with internal reasoning and never provided a corrected single-function output as required. This is an agent-side completion/format-following failure, not something inherent to the benchmark that would block any agent. | evidence: System requirement: ""Your response should ONLY consist of one python function... Your response should be in the format of ```python ```"". Agent produced once: ""```python\ndef required_function():\n    # Error occurred...\n    # Please implement...\n    raise NotImplementedError(...)\n```"" then continued generating thoughts and did not provide a final compliant function afterward (messages T0B6/T0B7 are only reasoning).

71,scicode,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The benchmark input is only an error message/commentary and contains no actual code snippet, function name, signature, or behavioral specification to reconstruct. As a result, there is no uniquely derivable 'required function' to implement or even to extract, making the task intrinsically underspecified: many different functions could satisfy the vague prompt. | causation_reasoning: Even though the task is underspecified, the agent also violated explicit system constraints by adding functionality that was not present in the input and by not strictly following the 'do NOT add or change any functionality inside the functions' requirement. The agent invented a function `required_function()` and a `raise NotImplementedError(...)` line despite there being no provided function to preserve. Thus the failure is attributable to agent behavior relative to the tool instructions, not solely to the benchmark deficiency. | evidence: User input contains only comments: ""# Error occurred: This method must be implemented in child classes\n# Please implement the required function manually"" and no python function/code.

80,scicode,1.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The benchmark input provides no actual python code or function signature to transform—only two comment lines describing an error (“This method must be implemented in child classes”). Given the system instruction that the tool ‘receives a block of text and python code and returns only a python function’ and ‘Do NOT add or change any functionality inside the functions,’ there is insufficient information to derive the required function name, parameters, body, or intended behavior. Any output would be guesswork, making the task intrinsically under-specified. | causation_reasoning: The agent’s failure is attributable to the benchmark deficiency: because the prompt supplies only an error message and no implementable stub/template, the agent cannot produce the correct required function. The agent consequently hallucinated/guessed function names and bodies (e.g., `def function()` / `def required_function()`), which is a direct consequence of missing specification rather than an implementation mistake on a well-formed task. | evidence: User input contains only: “# Error occurred: This method must be implemented in child classes\n# Please implement the required function manually” with no code/function signature.
