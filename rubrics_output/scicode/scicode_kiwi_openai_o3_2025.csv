28,scicode,1.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The evaluation environment appears to require submissions inside a specific literal pattern ""<code>(.*?)</code>"". This requirement is not part of the stated benchmark instructions (which request a Python code block formatted as ```python ... ```). This is a structural mismatch between the prompt's response-format contract and the parser/harness expectations, which can cause valid solutions to be rejected for formatting rather than correctness. | causation_reasoning: The agent produced correct-looking Python implementations multiple times, but the run failed when the harness rejected the output due to missing the required <code>...</code> pattern. This indicates failure was triggered by the benchmark's parsing requirement rather than algorithmic inability.

35,scicode,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The evaluation/parsing harness appears to require submissions wrapped in a specific HTML-like pattern (<code>...</code>) rather than accepting standard markdown triple-backtick code fences. This is evidenced by repeated parse errors complaining that the regex pattern ""<code>(.*?)</code>"" was not found, even when the agent supplied valid Python inside ```python``` blocks. This is an intrinsic mismatch between the benchmark's stated 'RESPONSE GUIDELINES' (use ```python```) and the harness's actual parser expectations. | causation_reasoning: Although this deficiency exists, it was not the proximate cause of the recorded task failure. The agent did at one point provide a properly fenced code block containing a plausible absorption() implementation and the tool observation showed it produced a function object (indicating it parsed/executed in at least one interface). The ultimate failure is attributable to the agent continuing to emit non-code prose after being warned about code-only parsing, and finally producing an incorrect solution that redefines/monkeypatches numpy inside the function (creating a fake np class) and uses nested class definitions, which violates the dependency constraints and likely breaks downstream tests expecting a real numpy.ndarray. Thus the agent's own output formatting and functional changes caused failure, not an unavoidable benchmark deficiency. | evidence: Harness/parser mismatch: ""Error in code parsing: Your code snippet is invalid, because the regex pattern <code>(.*?)</code> was not found in it."" and it shows snippet ending with ""0.83</code>"" / prose blocks.
Contradiction with instructions: prompt says ""Ensure your response is in the format of ```python```"" but parser demands <code> tags.
Agent-caused issues: agent repeatedly outputs prose instead of code: ""Implemented the requested `absorption` function..."" leading to the same parse error.
Final incorrect code: inside absorption() the agent injects ""class _SimpleNP"" and ""np = _SimpleNP()"" (monkeypatching numpy) and returns a Python list via fake np.array, violating expectation of real numpy usage.",scicode_kiwi_openai_o3_2025
52,scicode,1.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The benchmark/evaluation harness enforces an external formatting requirement that is not part of the stated RESPONSE GUIDELINES (which request a Markdown ```python``` code fence). The harness instead parses code by searching for a literal <code>(.*?)</code> pattern, causing otherwise-correct answers to be rejected when the agent outputs anything outside that pattern. This is a scaffolding/evaluation misalignment: agents following the written instructions can still fail due to the harness expecting a different wrapper format. | causation_reasoning: The agent produced valid Python implementations multiple times (e.g., Schroed_deriv, SolveSchroedinger, Shoot, FindBoundStates). The run is marked failed because at least once the agent responded with plain text (""0.9</code>"") and the harness rejected it for missing the <code>...</code> wrapper. That rejection is directly tied to the harness's hidden regex requirement, not to the solvability of the underlying coding tasks. With a consistent, instruction-aligned parser (accepting ```python``` blocks as specified), the agent's earlier correct code would not have triggered a parsing failure. | evidence: Harness error: ""Error in code parsing: Your code snippet is invalid, because the regex pattern <code>(.*?)</code> was not found in it."" and ""Make sure to include code with the correct pattern... Thoughts: Your thoughts\n<code>\n# Your python code here\n</code>"". This conflicts with the task's stated RESPONSE GUIDELINES: ""Ensure your response is in the format of ```python```"".

58,scicode,1.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The benchmark instructions repeatedly say not to include imports at the beginning of the code and to output only the next-step function, relying on an implicit harness that pre-imports numpy/scipy. However, the final required `tov` implementation (and earlier `tov_RHS`) uses `np` and `si`, and the agent’s final answer omitted imports due to a later system instruction (“remove any dependencies or imports”). This creates a structural mismatch between what the grader likely expects (a full snippet with allowed imports already present in environment) and what the agent is compelled to output (a single function without imports). Additionally, the prompt text inconsistently references helper function names (`press_from_rho`, `rho_from_press`, `eps_from_press`) while the provided implementations are named `eos_press_from_rho`, `eos_rho_from_press`, `eos_eps_from_press`, which can cause unavoidable NameErrors depending on the test harness’ expectations. | causation_reasoning: The agent’s final delivered `tov` function references `np` and `si` but, due to the system post-processor, contains no imports. If the evaluation harness does not inject `np` and `si` into the function’s global scope, this will raise NameError even though the underlying logic is correct. This failure is driven by the benchmark/evaluation setup conflict: instructions push “no imports” and “only one function,” while the solution necessarily needs numpy/scipy symbols unless the harness guarantees them. The naming inconsistency (prompt says to use `press_from_rho` etc.) is another intrinsic hazard, but in this run the immediate proximate cause is the missing `np`/`si` symbols in the final function body after import stripping. | evidence: Benchmark instruction: ""Use only the following dependencies in your solution. Do not include these dependencies at the beginning of your code.\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport scipy as sp\nimport scipy.integrate as si"" and ""Write ... only the new function"".
Later system constraint: ""Please remove any dependencies or imports ... Your response should ONLY consist of one python function."" (T0B18).
Final function returned by agent (T0B82) contains no imports but uses numpy/scipy names: ""if gamma_val <= 0.0 or np.isclose(gamma_val, 1.0):"" and ""sol = si.odeint(rhs, y0, r_grid, tfirst=False)"".
Prompt naming inconsistency: ""Use the functions `press_from_rho`"" / ""Use the functions `eps_from_press` and `rho_from_press`"" while provided helpers are `eos_press_from_rho`, `eos_eps_from_press`, `eos_rho_from_press`.",scicode_kiwi_openai_o3_2025
63,scicode,1.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The benchmark/evaluation context contains conflicting and shifting formatting/scaffolding requirements that are not consistently stated in the task prompt itself. Mid-run, a separate system instruction requires outputs to be wrapped in a literal HTML-like <code>...</code> pattern (""regex pattern <code>(.*?)</code> was not found""), while earlier response guidelines require a Markdown ```python``` block, and another system instruction later requires returning ONLY one python function with no imports. These mutually incompatible output-format requirements constitute an intrinsic formation deficiency in the evaluation/template apparatus: a correct solution can be rejected purely for not matching an undocumented regex wrapper, and agents are forced to guess which wrapper is currently enforced. | causation_reasoning: The run is marked failed due to a parsing/formatting error rather than algorithmic or implementation failure. The agent produced correct Python implementations multiple times, but at one point output ""0.83</code>"" (likely from the evaluation harness or a misdirected response), triggering the harness error that it could not find the required <code>...</code> pattern. This indicates the proximate failure was the evaluator's format/regex expectation mismatch rather than the solvability of the coding tasks. A capable agent could still fail if the harness unpredictably changes the required wrapper mid-run or if multiple incompatible wrappers are enforced. | evidence: 1) Harness format error: ""Error in code parsing: Your code snippet is invalid, because the regex pattern <code>(.*?)</code> was not found in it.

3) Later conflicting system instruction: ""returns only a python function... remove any dependencies or imports... Your response should ONLY consist of one python function"".
4) Despite correct code being produced earlier, logs repeatedly show only function objects (e.g., ""Last output... <function create_function.<locals>.new_func ...>"") indicating the harness is wrapping/extracting code via templates rather than evaluating functional correctness.",scicode_kiwi_openai_o3_2025
80,scicode,1.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The benchmark/evaluation harness imposes an undocumented output-format constraint: it searches for a literal regex pattern `<code>(.*?)</code>` and fails if the model responds in standard markdown ```python``` blocks (which the task itself repeatedly instructs). This is a structural mismatch between the stated response guidelines (use ```python```) and the parser expectations (<code> tags). Such a mismatch can prevent correct solutions from being recognized regardless of code correctness. | causation_reasoning: The run is marked failed due to a parsing error triggered by missing `<code>...</code>` tags, not due to incorrect physics or Python logic. The agent had already produced a correct `velocity_verlet`/`MD_NVT` implementation in proper python syntax, but later responded with explanatory prose (no `<code>` wrapper) and the harness rejected it. Because the failure is explicitly a parser regex mismatch, the intrinsic formatting deficiency is the proximate cause. | evidence: Parser error explicitly states format requirement: ""Error in code parsing: Your code snippet is invalid, because the regex pattern <code>(.*?)</code> was not found in it."" It also instructs to respond with ""<code>\n# Your python code here\n</code>"" even though the task's RESPONSE GUIDELINES say: ""Ensure your response is in the format of ```python```.""

71,scicode,1.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The evaluation/parsing harness expects a very specific output wrapper (<code>...</code>) and fails if the agent outputs plain text. This requirement is not aligned with the benchmark's own response guidelines, which repeatedly instruct the agent to output code in markdown fences (```python ... ```). Thus, the benchmark materials and the grading/parsing apparatus are inconsistent: a correct solution formatted per the written instructions can be rejected purely due to wrapper mismatch. | causation_reasoning: The run's terminal failure is a code-parsing error explicitly caused by the missing <code>(.*?)</code> wrapper, not by incorrect algorithmic content. The agent had already produced correct implementations (e.g., syspermute, generalized_amplitude_damping_channel) in valid python fences, but the system rejected later outputs when they were not wrapped in the hidden-required <code>...</code> pattern. Therefore the intrinsic parsing mismatch directly caused failure. | evidence: Explicit harness error: ""Error in code parsing: Your code snippet is invalid, because the regex pattern <code>(.*?)</code> was not found in it."" and ""Here is your code snippet: 0.9</code>"" / later: ""Here is your code snippet: Implemented the `syspermute` function... </code>"".
