35,scicode,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The user input provides no actual code block or specification of what function should do beyond an error string.

The agent first output a class (not allowed), then output a function that simply raises NotImplementedError rather than implementing anything. The immediate failure is attributable to agent noncompliance/incorrect implementation rather than an unavoidable benchmark barrier (a compliant agent could at least output a single function per format constraints, though correctness vs hidden tests would still be impossible). | evidence: User message contains only: ""# Error occurred: This method must be implemented in child classes\n# Please implement the required function manually"" with no code/signature.
