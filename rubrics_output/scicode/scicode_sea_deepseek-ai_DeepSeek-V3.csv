12,scicode,1.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The benchmark prompt contains mutually incompatible requirements: it asks the agent to produce a facts survey and a plan (“First in part 1, write the facts survey, then in part 2, write your plan.”) and to stop after emitting “<end_plan>”. Simultaneously, the embedded “RESPONSE GUIDELINES” demand a single ```python``` code block implementing the function and explicitly say not to include test code or anything else. These directives cannot all be satisfied in one response, creating an intrinsic formation deficiency in the task specification. | causation_reasoning: The agent failed because there was no possible compliant output format that would satisfy both (a) the meta-instruction to output a facts survey/plan with <end_plan> and (b) the requirement to output only executable Python code in a single code block implementing f_Schrod. Since the trace shows the agent never got to attempt implementation (only the initial user prompt is present and the run is marked failed), the failure is attributable to this contradiction rather than an implementation mistake. | evidence: Conflicting instructions in the prompt: (1) “First in part 1, write the facts survey, then in part 2, write your plan.” and “After writing the final step of the plan, write the '<end_plan>' tag and stop there.” versus (2) “RESPONSE GUIDELINES: 1. Write the complete and executable Python program ... in a single block.” and “5. Ensure your response is in the format of ```python```.” The run metadata shows no agent response content beyond the prompt and “failed"": true, indicating the task setup likely prevented a valid response.",scicode_sea_deepseek-ai_DeepSeek-V3
2,scicode,1.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The benchmark constrains dependencies to NumPy and scipy.integrate.simpson, but a reasonable implementation of a cylindrically symmetric diffraction integral commonly uses a Bessel function (e.g., J0). The provided dependency list in the task text does not include scipy.special, yet the agent (reasonably) used `from scipy.special import jv`. This indicates a formation deficiency: the task implicitly requires special functions for an efficient/standard solution, but the allowed/declared dependencies omit them. Additionally, the evaluation harness later demands stripping imports, which would break such a solution unless the environment injects those names—another scaffold misalignment risk. | causation_reasoning: The run is marked failed at the end during the ""tool that receives a block of text and python code and returns only a python function"" phase. At that stage, the agent is instructed to remove imports; removing imports would leave `np`, `simps`, and `jv` undefined, causing failure if executed. Because the benchmark simultaneously (a) restricts dependencies and (b) uses a post-processor that forces imports to be removed without guaranteeing those symbols exist, even a correct implementation can be made non-runnable by the harness. This structural mismatch, not an algorithmic mistake, is the proximate cause of failure. | evidence: Task dependency section only includes:
- ""import numpy as np"" and ""from scipy.integrate import simpson as simps"" (no scipy.special).
Agent solution uses an undeclared dependency: ""from scipy.special import jv"".
Postprocessing harness instruction: ""Please remove any dependencies or imports from the code... Your response should ONLY consist of one python function."" 
Agent notes consequence: ""If the imports are removed, the function will break... the code uses np.linspace or jv would cause errors."" 
Run metadata: ""failed"": true.",scicode_sea_deepseek-ai_DeepSeek-V3
28,scicode,1.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The benchmark prompt instructs the agent to implement a Python function in a single ```python``` block (""Write the complete and executable Python program..."" / ""DO NOT include... test code""), but the outer user instruction for this run asks for a facts survey and plan only (""First in part 1, write the facts survey, then in part 2, write your plan.""). These are contradictory task requirements. Additionally, the provided trace contains only the user prompt and no actual agent completion, so the run is not a meaningful evaluation of solving the coding task; the evaluation apparatus is effectively misconfigured for this transcript. | causation_reasoning: Because the instructions are mutually exclusive (planning-only vs code-only response), no agent can satisfy both simultaneously. This intrinsic conflict plausibly led to the run being marked failed without any substantive agent attempt shown. The absence of an agent response in the trace further indicates the failure is attributable to benchmark/evaluation setup rather than an agent implementation error. | evidence: Contradictory instructions: (a) planning request: ""First in part 1, write the facts survey, then in part 2, write your plan."" and earlier ""Don't make any assumptions... Do not add anything else""; vs (b) coding-only requirements: ""Write the complete and executable Python program... in a single block"" and ""DO NOT include previous function code, example usage or test code in your response."" Also, the transcript shows no agent output at all (message_count=1; only user content), yet run is marked ""failed"": true.",scicode_sea_deepseek-ai_DeepSeek-V3
35,scicode,1.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The benchmark prompt contains mutually incompatible directives about what the agent should output. It embeds a SciCode-style coding task requiring implementation of `ground_state_wavelength` in a single ```python``` code block, but then immediately overrides with: ""First in part 1, write the facts survey, then in part 2, write your plan."" These are different output modalities (narrative facts/plan vs executable code-only response) and cannot both be satisfied in one response under the provided ""RESPONSE GUIDELINES"" that demand only code and no test/example. This is an intrinsic formation deficiency because it creates ambiguity/contradiction in required output, independent of agent capability. | causation_reasoning: The run shows the agent produced no solution messages and the run is marked failed. Given the contradictory instructions, an agent following the final instruction to provide facts+plan would violate the earlier requirement to output only a Python program; conversely, outputting only code would violate the final facts+plan instruction. This structural contradiction can cause immediate evaluation failure regardless of agent competence, and plausibly explains why the run failed without any agent output. | evidence: Contradictory instructions in the task: (1) Code-only requirement: ""Write the complete and executable Python program... Ensure your response is in the format of ```python```"" and ""DO NOT include previous function code, example usage or test code in your response."" (2) Conflicting final instruction: ""First in part 1, write the facts survey, then in part 2, write your plan.""

52,scicode,1.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The benchmark task is internally inconsistent and mixes two different evaluation contexts. It first instructs the agent to implement a specific physics function (SolveSchroedinger / Schroed_deriv) under strict response guidelines (no extra code, no nested functions, only specified dependencies, and do not include imports). Later, a system message changes the task to a different transformation: ""return only a python function"" and ""remove any dependencies or imports"" and ""ONLY consist of one python function"". Additionally, the task text itself contains irrelevant/erroneous pasted content (a long <think> monologue and function-object repr strings like ""<function create_function.<locals>.new_func ...>"") that are not actionable specifications. This misalignment would confuse any agent and makes it impossible to satisfy all constraints simultaneously (e.g., solve the physics ODE integration while also stripping imports and outputting a single function in a different sanitization mode). | causation_reasoning: The agent's failure is driven by the benchmark's conflicting scaffolding. The run shows the environment/harness switching into a ""code sanitization"" mode requiring a single function and no imports, while the original benchmark task requires an ODE integrator using scipy/numpy. The agent repeatedly responds under shifting requirements and the trace never shows a stable, testable evaluation of correctness—only the harness printing function objects (""<function create_function.<locals>.new_func ...>"") instead of running functional tests. Given these contradictory instructions and evaluation context switching, the agent cannot produce an answer that will be accepted consistently; the failure is therefore attributable to the formation deficiency rather than solely agent logic. | evidence: 1) Original task response rules: ""Use only the following dependencies... Do not include these dependencies at the beginning of your code."" and ""DO NOT include previous function code, example usage or test code"".
2) Later system instruction changes format/goal: ""You are a tool... returns only a python function... Please remove any dependencies or imports... Your response should ONLY consist of one python function."" (T0B12).
3) Contaminated/irrelevant pasted content in the task: repeated inclusion of the agent's own <think> text and function repr strings like ""<function create_function.<locals>.new_func at 0x...>"" (e.g., T0B13, T0B16).
4) Harness outputs show only function objects rather than evaluating task success: ""Last output from code snippet: <function create_function.<locals>.new_func at ...>"" (T0B7, T0B19, T0B22, T0B26, T0B32, T0B35).
5) The task also contradicts itself on nesting: approach guidelines say ""Do not attempt to write nested functions"", yet agent is pushed into defining derivative helpers inside SolveSchroedinger in later attempts due to missing prior context.",scicode_sea_deepseek-ai_DeepSeek-V3
58,scicode,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The benchmark materials contain an internal inconsistency: in the second task, the docstring says the output is `eps` (specific internal energy) while the problem statement explicitly says the function must return density `rho` (and even highlights this mismatch as IMPORTANT). This is a formation/scaffolding deficiency because the provided template text conflicts with the intended behavior, which could mislead an agent about what to return/document. | causation_reasoning: Despite the inconsistency, the agent implemented the correct inverse formula and returned `rho`. There is no evidence the agent was blocked by the mismatch; they followed the IMPORTANT note and produced a correct function. The run is marked failed by the harness, but the trace does not show any evaluation error attributable to the benchmark inconsistency. Therefore, any failure is not proximately caused by this deficiency (it may be due to external grading/harness issues not evidenced here). | evidence: Inconsistency in prompt: ""**IMPORTANT**: NOTE: Despite the docstring mentioning 'eps'... this function computes and returns DENSITY (rho)"" while the template still says ""Outputs:\n    eps: the specific internal energy..."".
Agent output matches intended behavior: `return (press / eos_kappa) ** (1.0 / eos_Gamma)` and later minimized to `def eos_rho_from_press(...): return (press / eos_kappa) ** (1.0 / eos_Gamma)`.
No runtime errors shown; interpreter outputs only function objects (e.g., `<function create_function.<locals>.new_func ...>`).",scicode_sea_deepseek-ai_DeepSeek-V3
63,scicode,1.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The benchmark prompt contains mutually incompatible instructions about what the agent should output. It asks the agent (outside the embedded problem) to produce a ""Facts survey"" and ""Plan"" and stop at <end_plan>, while the embedded PROBLEM DESCRIPTION/RESPONSE GUIDELINES require returning a single ```python``` code block implementing the function. These two required output formats cannot both be satisfied in one response, creating an intrinsic formation deficiency in the task setup. | causation_reasoning: Because the run contains only the user prompt and no agent response, the failure is best explained by the contradictory output requirements: any agent following the top-level instruction (facts survey + plan) would violate the embedded requirement to output only code, and any agent following the embedded code-only requirement would violate the top-level requirement to output facts survey + plan. This structural conflict would impede any agent and is the proximate cause of failure. | evidence: Top-level instruction: ""First in part 1, write the facts survey, then in part 2, write your plan."" and ""After writing the final step of the plan, write the '<end_plan>' tag and stop there."" Embedded requirement: ""RESPONSE GUIDELINES: ... Write the complete and executable Python program ... Ensure your response is in the format of ```python```.""

71,scicode,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The benchmark materials contain conflicting instructions about what the agent should output. The task description asks the agent to implement the function `ket(dim, args)` and return code only, but the very last line instructs: ""First in part 1, write the facts survey, then in part 2, write your plan."" These are incompatible output requirements (analysis-only text vs. code-only in a ```python``` block). Additionally, the NOTE flags an interface inconsistency (mentions header only has 'dim' but tests call two-argument form), indicating scaffolding confusion, though the provided header already includes two parameters. | causation_reasoning: The agent run contains no actual agent response/content beyond the initial user prompt, so there is no evidence the agent attempted to follow either the code-output guideline or the facts/plan instruction and then failed due to the conflict. The failure appears to be due to the agent not producing an answer at all (or the transcript being incomplete), not due to an unavoidable benchmark deficiency encountered during implementation or evaluation. Therefore, deficiency did not demonstrably cause this specific failure. | evidence: Conflicting requirements: ""Write the complete and executable Python program... Ensure your response is in the format of ```python```"" vs. ""First in part 1, write the facts survey, then in part 2, write your plan."" Also noted inconsistency: ""NOTE: Function header only has 'dim' parameter but test cases call ket(2, 0)...""

80,scicode,1.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The benchmark instructions conflict with the evaluation context: the task says “Use only the following dependencies… Do not include these dependencies at the beginning of your code,” yet the function implementation relies on numpy as `np`. In the final step, the harness explicitly strips imports (“Please remove any dependencies or imports”), leaving a function body that references `np` without any guarantee that `np` exists in the execution namespace. This structural mismatch can cause runtime NameError for any agent that follows both constraints. | causation_reasoning: The agent’s final submitted function is `def dist(...)` that calls `np.subtract`, `np.round`, and `np.linalg.norm` but contains no import. Given the harness instruction to remove imports and output only a single function, the produced solution cannot be self-contained. If the grader does not pre-inject `np` into globals, execution fails due to NameError. The agent otherwise implemented the correct minimum-image logic; the failure is best explained by the benchmark/harness preventing inclusion of required dependency setup. | evidence: Task constraint: “Use only the following dependencies in your solution. Do not include these dependencies at the beginning of your code.”
Harness constraint: “Please remove any dependencies or imports… Your response should ONLY consist of one python function.”
