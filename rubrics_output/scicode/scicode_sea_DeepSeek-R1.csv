2,scicode,1.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The benchmark prompt contains mutually incompatible instructions about what the agent should output. It first asks the agent to produce a ""facts survey"" and ""plan"" (a planning-only response), but inside the embedded ""PROBLEM DESCRIPTION"" it also demands: ""Write the complete and executable Python program ... Ensure your response is in the format of ```python```"" and ""DO NOT include ... test code"". These requirements cannot be simultaneously satisfied in a single response: a facts survey/plan is not a python code block implementing the function, and a python-only code block cannot also be a structured facts survey/plan. This is an intrinsic formation deficiency because it creates a double-bind regardless of agent capability. | causation_reasoning: The run shows immediate failure with only the initial user message and no agent response, consistent with the agent being blocked by contradictory response-format requirements. Since the benchmark requires both a planning artifact and a pure code artifact, any attempt would violate at least one set of instructions, leading to failure. Thus the deficiency plausibly caused the failure rather than an agent-side implementation bug. | evidence: Conflicting directives in the same task: (1) ""Below I will present you a task. You will need to 1. build a survey of facts ... then 2. make a plan of action"" and ""First in part 1, write the facts survey, then in part 2, write your plan.""

28,scicode,1.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The benchmark prompt is internally contradictory about what the agent should output. It first instructs the agent to produce a ""facts survey"" and a ""plan"" (meta-planning output) and explicitly says: ""First in part 1, write the facts survey, then in part 2, write your plan."" However, the embedded programming task section simultaneously requires: ""Write the complete and executable Python program... Ensure your response is in the format of ```python```"" and ""DO NOT include ... test code"". These two output requirements cannot both be satisfied in a single response: one demands structured prose headings and an <end_plan> tag, while the other demands only a Python code block implementing propagate_gaussian_beam. This is an intrinsic formation deficiency because it creates an impossible compliance target regardless of agent capability. | causation_reasoning: The run contains no agent attempt/response; it is marked failed after a single user message. Given the contradictory output specifications, any agent that follows the top-level instruction (facts survey + plan) would violate the code-only requirement, and any agent that outputs only code would violate the facts-survey/plan requirement. Thus the failure is attributable to the benchmark's conflicting instructions rather than agent reasoning or implementation mistakes. | evidence: Conflicting directives in the prompt: (1) Meta-planning requirement: ""You will need to 1. build a survey of facts... then 2. make a plan..."" and ""First in part 1, write the facts survey, then in part 2, write your plan.""

35,scicode,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The benchmark prompt contains conflicting instructions about what the agent should output. The outer wrapper instructs: ""First in part 1, write the facts survey, then in part 2, write your plan."" But the embedded coding task's RESPONSE GUIDELINES require: ""Write the complete and executable Python program ... Ensure your response is in the format of ```python```"" and ""DO NOT include ... test code"". These goals are mutually exclusive in a single response: a facts survey/plan is not a Python program, and a Python-only code block is not a facts survey/plan. This is an intrinsic formation deficiency (contradictory output requirements). | causation_reasoning: Even though the prompt is contradictory, the trace does not show the agent attempting either output format, receiving an evaluation error, or failing due to the contradiction. The run contains only the user prompt and no agent response, so the recorded failure cannot be attributed to the benchmark deficiency versus agent non-response or external evaluation conditions. Without evidence of an error triggered by the conflict (e.g., format rejection), causation is not established. | evidence: Conflicting instructions: (1) Outer instruction: ""First in part 1, write the facts survey, then in part 2, write your plan."" (2) Embedded coding instruction: ""Write the complete and executable Python program ...

52,scicode,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The benchmark materials contain an internal contradiction and misalignment across phases. Initially, the user instruction requires a 'facts survey' and 'plan' only, but the embedded task's 'RESPONSE GUIDELINES' require returning only a single ```python``` block implementing the function. Later, the system adds a post-processing instruction: 'Remove any dependencies or imports... Do NOT add or change any functionality inside the functions... Your response should ONLY consist of one python function.' This conflicts with the function's dependence on numpy (np.array) while also demanding removal of 'import numpy as np', creating an impossible constraint if interpreted literally (removing the import breaks the function unless functionality is changed by avoiding np.array). This is an intrinsic formation deficiency because the instructions cannot all be simultaneously satisfied without breaking either the 'no imports' or 'no functionality changes' rule. | causation_reasoning: Despite the contradictory instructions, the recorded failure is attributable to the agent's behavior rather than an unavoidable benchmark block. The agent did not complete the required transformation step; it began a long chain-of-thought analysis ('<think> ...') and never produced the required final single-function output. The trace ends mid-reasoning, indicating non-completion/format noncompliance. A capable agent could still output the function (even if it references np) in the required format and let the broader harness provide imports, or could follow the system tool's directive by outputting just the function and accept that 'np' is expected to exist in the evaluation context. Thus the deficiency was present but not the proximate cause of this run's failure; the agent failed by not producing the requested final output. | evidence: Contradictory constraints appear in the system post-processor: 'Please remove any dependencies or imports from the code... Do NOT add or change any functionality inside the functions... Your response should ONLY consist of one python function.' The provided function uses numpy: 'return np.array([uprime, u_double_prime])' while the input includes 'import numpy as np'. The agent then stalls and never outputs the required function-only response: it starts with '<think> ...' and the trace cuts off mid-analysis without a final ```python``` function.",scicode_sea_DeepSeek-R1
58,scicode,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The benchmark materials contain conflicting and confusing instructions. The user is repeatedly instructed to produce a 'facts survey and plan', but the underlying programming task requires only implementing a simple function. Later, the conversation introduces an unrelated 'tool that returns only a python function' meta-instruction and then switches to a different next-step function (density-from-pressure) with a docstring that incorrectly claims it returns 'eps'. These shifts/mismatches indicate formation/template issues that could confuse an agent about what is being graded and which function is actually required. | causation_reasoning: Despite the confusing scaffolding, the agent successfully produced the correct implementation for the original requested function (pressure from density): `press = eos_kappa * (rho ** eos_Gamma)`. The run is marked failed, but there is no trace evidence of an evaluation-time error or an impossibility caused by the benchmark; rather, the agent appears to go off-track producing extra/unrequested functions (e.g., `eos_eps_from_press`) and mixing plans with code. This is agent-side instruction-following/trajectory failure, not a benchmark deficiency that makes success impossible. | evidence: Conflicting instructions: 'First in part 1, write the facts survey, then in part 2, write your plan.' yet later 'RESPONSE GUIDELINES... DO NOT include ... test code'.
Docstring mismatch in new step: '**IMPORTANT**... this function computes and returns DENSITY (rho)... Despite the docstring mentioning \'eps\''.
Agent nonetheless provides correct target function multiple times: `press = eos_kappa * (rho ** eos_Gamma)` (e.g., T0B1, T0B39, T0B41, T0B60).
Agent goes off-task: provides `eos_eps_from_press` (T0B42 onward) which is not requested by the initial pressure-from-density task.

63,scicode,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The benchmark prompt contains conflicting directives about what the agent should output. It simultaneously instructs the agent to (a) produce a facts survey and plan (""First in part 1, write the facts survey, then in part 2, write your plan."" with an <end_plan> stop condition) and (b) implement and return an executable Python program in a single ```python``` block, explicitly disallowing tests/examples (""Write the complete and executable Python program... Ensure your response is in the format of ```python```.""). These requirements cannot be satisfied in a single response without violating one set of instructions, indicating an intrinsic formation deficiency in the task setup. | causation_reasoning: Despite the contradictory instructions, the trace does not show the agent producing any output, attempting code, or encountering an evaluation error tied to these conflicts. The run metadata only indicates ""failed"": true with no intermediate steps, error messages, or agent response. Therefore, we cannot attribute the failure causally to the prompt deficiency; the failure could be due to missing agent response, tool/harness issues, or other unobserved factors. | evidence: Conflicting instructions present in the prompt: ""First in part 1, write the facts survey, then in part 2, write your plan."" and earlier: ""Write the complete and executable Python program for the next step in a single block...

71,scicode,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The benchmark materials contain a clear inconsistency: the NOTE claims a function header mismatch (""Function header only has 'dim' parameter"") while simultaneously providing a two-argument header `def ket(dim, args):`, and stating that tests call `ket(2, 0)`, `ket(2, [1,1])`, `ket([2,3], [0,1])`. This indicates the problem statement/template has conflicting guidance about the required signature and could confuse agents about how many parameters to implement. | causation_reasoning: Despite the inconsistency, it did not cause the observed failure in this run. The agent never attempted to implement the function; the run ends immediately after the user prompt/instructions with `""failed"": true` and no agent output/trace showing an implementation error, runtime error, or test failure attributable to the signature confusion. The failure appears to be due to the agent not producing any response (or otherwise failing outside the problem's technical constraints), not because the benchmark made the task impossible. | evidence: Problem NOTE: ""Function header only has 'dim' parameter but test cases call ket(2, 0)... with two arguments."" Yet the provided header is `def ket(dim, args):`.

80,scicode,1.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The benchmark/harness introduces a post-processing instruction that conflicts with the task's allowed-dependencies setup. The task explicitly allows use of numpy (and lists it in dependencies), but then a system instruction forces removal of imports and returns “ONLY one python function”, which makes references to np invalid unless the harness injects np. This is a scaffolding/evaluation misalignment: a correct solution using np as intended by the task becomes non-executable after import-stripping. | causation_reasoning: The agent's final delivered function for `dist` uses `np` but, due to the harness/system instruction, the import was removed: `def dist(...): delta = np.subtract(...) ...`. If the grader runs this function in isolation without predefining `np`, it will raise NameError. This is not an agent logic error (the implementation is standard and correct under the stated dependencies); the failure is caused by the benchmark's contradictory requirement to remove imports while still expecting numpy usage. | evidence: Task dependencies: “Use only the following dependencies... import numpy as np ... Do not include these dependencies at the beginning of your code.”
System instruction later: “Please remove any dependencies or imports from the code... Your response should ONLY consist of one python function.”
