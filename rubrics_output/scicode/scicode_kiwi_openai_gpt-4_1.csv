2,scicode,1.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The benchmark's evaluation harness appears to require the assistant's final response to include a literal `<code>...</code>` block (or match a regex that extracts code from that tag), but the task instructions simultaneously require the response to be in a Markdown triple-backtick python block. This mismatch is intrinsic to the benchmark interface: even a correct solution can be rejected if not wrapped in the expected `<code>` tag. Additionally, the prompt says ""Do not include these dependencies at the beginning of your code"" but also provides dependencies to be used, creating confusion about where imports are permitted; however, the proximate failure here is the `<code>`-tag regex requirement. | causation_reasoning: The agent's failure was directly caused by the evaluator's code-parsing rule, not by the underlying optics implementation. The agent attempted to return the answer via `final_answer(...)` containing prose rather than a `<code>...</code>` snippet; the harness then threw a parsing error because it could not find `<code>(.*?)</code>`. This is an evaluation/formatting deficiency: if the harness accepted standard markdown code fences as the instructions requested (or didn't require `<code>` tags), the run would not have failed at this stage. | evidence: Evaluator error: ""Error in code parsing: Your code snippet is invalid, because the regex pattern <code>(.*?)</code> was not found in it.""

35,scicode,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: There is an intrinsic scaffold/evaluation mismatch: the environment later enforces a post-processing constraint (“returns only a python function… remove imports… ONLY consist of one python function”), which conflicts with earlier response guidelines asking for a full program in a ```python``` block and earlier allowing imports. Additionally, the harness expects final submissions in a specific wrapper/format (it searches for a `<code>...</code>` blob), which is not stated in the original task prompt and can cause parsing failure even when the solution function is correct. | causation_reasoning: The agent’s run includes at least one parsing failure attributable to the harness (<code> regex not found) but the agent then successfully provided the requested function in plain ```python``` format. The final recorded failure is not shown to be caused by the benchmark mismatch; rather, the agent later derailed by producing an unrelated function (`smallest_quadratic_combinations`) and then, for `absorption`, returned a Python list instead of the specified NumPy array, and also altered code (removed `np.ceil`) contrary to earlier version. These are agent mistakes that would fail typical unit tests independent of the harness issues. | evidence: Harness parsing error: “Error in code parsing: Your code snippet is invalid, because the regex pattern <code>(.*?)</code> was not found in it.”
Conflicting system constraint: “Your response should ONLY consist of one python function. Please remove any dependencies or imports…”
Agent off-task output: “```python

28,scicode,1.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The benchmark/environment has at least two intrinsic mismatches with the task spec that can break otherwise-correct solutions. (1) The execution environment does not support Python's matrix-multiplication operator '@' (MatMult), but the task explicitly provides/encourages using ABCD matrices and the agent's natural implementation used '@', which immediately fails at runtime. This is an environment capability gap not stated in the task. (2) The evaluation harness expects a very specific output format containing a <code>(...)</code> blob (regex-based extraction). The task instructions to the agent say to return a Python code block, but the harness later rejects the agent's 'final_answer(""""""..."""""")' because it does not contain the required <code>...</code> wrapper. This is a scaffolding/evaluation misalignment: the benchmark's parsing expectations are not aligned with the stated response guidelines. | causation_reasoning: The agent's run is marked failed due to these intrinsic issues. First, a correct unit test attempt crashed because '@' is unsupported: the agent could not proceed with validation without rewriting away from '@'. Later, even after producing a reasonable implementation, the run hit a parsing failure because the harness required a <code>...</code> wrapper that the instructions did not mandate; this directly produced an 'invalid code snippet' error. These are proximate causes of failure attributable to benchmark/environment constraints rather than core algorithmic reasoning. | evidence: Unsupported operator: ""NotImplementedError: Binary operation MatMult is not implemented."" (at line using ""Mtot1 = Mf1 @ Mprop1"").
Parsing/evaluator misalignment: ""Error in code parsing: Your code snippet is invalid, because the regex pattern <code>(.*?)</code> was not found in it."" after the agent returned code via final_answer triple-quoted string.
Task asks for ABCD matrix method (likely encouraging matrix ops): ""using ABCD matrix"" while environment forbids '@' without warning.",scicode_kiwi_openai_gpt-4_1
52,scicode,1.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The benchmark/harness imposes an additional hidden formatting/parsing requirement that is inconsistent with the task's response guidelines. The harness repeatedly errors with ""regex pattern <code>(.*?)</code> was not found"" unless content is wrapped in literal <code>...</code> tags, which is not part of the stated instructions (which ask for a ```python``` block). This indicates a misalignment between the evaluation parser and the prompt's required output format, making correct solutions fail to be accepted when not wrapped in an unstated tag. | causation_reasoning: The agent produced correct Python implementations for the requested functions (e.g., FindBoundStates), but the run is marked failed due to parser errors from the evaluation system rather than incorrect logic. The decisive failures occurred when the agent attempted to provide answers/tests in ways that did not satisfy the harness's hidden <code> tag regex, causing rejection even though the underlying code was correct. Thus the intrinsic formatting/parser deficiency was the proximate cause of failure. | evidence: Parser failures: ""Error in code parsing: Your code snippet is invalid, because the regex pattern <code>(.*?)</code> was not found in it."" occurs multiple times (e.g., at T0B16, T0B58, T0B71). The harness explicitly instructs wrapping output in <code> tags: ""It seems like you're trying to return the final answer, you can do it as follows: <code>\n                final_answer(\""YOUR FINAL ANSWER HERE\"")\n                </code>"" (T0B16/T0B71). The stated response guideline instead requires markdown fences: ""Ensure your response is in the format of ```python```"" (task text). Agent produced correct code blocks (e.g., FindBoundStates at T0B72/T0B74) but run metadata shows ""failed"": true while the errors shown are parser/formatting related rather than code correctness.",scicode_kiwi_openai_gpt-4_1
58,scicode,1.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The run shows the benchmark/evaluation layer changing the required response format midstream via an additional system instruction that forces outputs to be wrapped in a literal <code>...</code> block and to return only a single function, while earlier task instructions required a full python program in a ```python``` fence (and sometimes multiple functions). This creates a structural mismatch between what the agent is told to output and what the parser expects at different points. Additionally, the evaluation harness emits a parsing error tied to a regex expecting <code>(.*?)</code>, indicating the scorer is brittle to formatting and can reject otherwise-correct code when not embedded exactly as expected. These are intrinsic apparatus/template issues, not problem-solving issues. | causation_reasoning: The agent produced correct implementations for the requested physics/EOS functions and even validated them with tests. The eventual failure is due to the harness/postprocessor rejecting the final submission because it was not in the exact wrapper format the regex expects and because later a system postprocessor stripped required integration code (commented out np/si usage) causing an incomplete final function. This failure mode would occur regardless of solution quality if the formatting constraints are inconsistent or the postprocessor removes essential code. Thus the intrinsic scaffold/parsing deficiency is the proximate cause of the recorded failure. | evidence: 1) Harness parsing error: ""Error in code parsing: Your code snippet is invalid, because the regex pattern <code>(.*?)</code> was not found in it."" after the agent attempted to return via final_answer.
2) Conflicting system requirement mid-run: ""You are a tool that receives a block of text and python code and returns only a python function... Your response should ONLY consist of one python function..."" which contradicts earlier 'Write the complete and executable Python program' instructions.
3) Postprocessed/stripped final output for tov: the assistant output shows critical lines commented out: ""# np =\n# si =\n\n# r = np.linspace(1e-8, rmax, npoints) ... # return (mass_surf, lapse_center)"" indicating the formatting/tooling layer removed non-function code/import bindings required for execution.",scicode_kiwi_openai_gpt-4_1
63,scicode,1.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The benchmark provides upstream helper functions that are either explicitly incorrect or internally inconsistent with the stated dependency constraints and numerical intent. In particular, the provided `construct_matrix` returns a placeholder structure `D = [(-lower_diag, main_diag, -upper_diag)]` and explicitly states it ""does NOT build the real matrix"", yet later steps (and the allowed dependencies) require using `scipy.sparse.diags`/`spsolve` with a proper matrix. This creates a structural contradiction: an agent following the provided pipeline will either (a) propagate the placeholder and fail at runtime/type level, or (b) deviate from the provided code/spec and implement a different matrix scheme. Additionally, the benchmark never specifies the finite-difference scheme (explicit/implicit/Crank–Nicolson) and provides inconsistent coefficient usage across steps (e.g., differing interpretations of `beta` vs `1-beta`), making the numerical target underspecified; valid schemes exist but the evaluation appears to assume a particular one while earlier code does not support it. | causation_reasoning: The agent's failure is directly triggered by the benchmark's placeholder/inconsistent upstream code: when the agent attempted to integrate the provided `construct_matrix` output into `price_option`, execution failed with a `TypeError` caused by applying unary minus to a list (originating from the placeholder D structure). Later, even when the agent tried to implement an implicit scheme in `price_option_of_time`, the pipeline produced astronomically large values, consistent with the benchmark not providing a coherent, stable discretization to follow and leaving critical scheme details unspecified. While the agent made additional mistakes (e.g., later returning an incomplete function with `pass`), the initial and central failure mode (inability to run the combined solver using provided helpers) stems from the intrinsic benchmark deficiency: the benchmark-supplied `construct_matrix` is nonfunctional by design and incompatible with later required operations. | evidence: 1) Benchmark-provided code: ""D = [(-lower_diag, main_diag, -upper_diag)] # this does NOT build the real matrix!"" in `construct_matrix`.
2) Runtime failure when using provided pipeline: ""TypeError: bad operand type for unary -: 'list'"" at call `V = price_option(...)`.
3) The trace notes the mismatch: ""**IMPORTANT**: NOTE: The matrix D shape in the docstring is incorrectly stated..."" indicating spec inconsistency.
4) Agent's attempt to use placeholder D in `forward_iteration` includes unpacking diagonals and building `sparse.diags`, showing the expected need for a real matrix that the benchmark does not provide.",scicode_kiwi_openai_gpt-4_1
80,scicode,1.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The benchmark/evaluation scaffolding enforces a specific output-extraction mechanism that requires the agent's final response to contain a <code>...</code> blob (as indicated by the parser error referencing regex <code>(.*?)</code>). However, the agent is repeatedly instructed elsewhere to respond in ```python``` blocks, and at times the harness expects a plain function body without wrapper text. This inconsistency in expected response format is intrinsic to the benchmark setup and can prevent correct code from being parsed/graded even when the implementation itself is correct. | causation_reasoning: The run ultimately failed because the evaluation harness rejected the agent's 'final_answer' submission due to missing the required <code>...</code> wrapper, not because the algorithmic implementation was wrong. The agent had already produced correct implementations (and even unit-tested some earlier steps), but the harness could not parse the final submission format. Fixing the benchmark's response-format expectations (or making them consistent) would likely allow the agent to pass. | evidence: Parser failures: ""Error in code parsing: Your code snippet is invalid, because the regex pattern <code>(.*?)</code> was not found in it."" shown after attempts like:
""final_answer(\n\""\""\""\nThe implementation is complete: ...\""\""\""\n)"" and later similarly for velocity_verlet and MD_NVT.
Also explicit instruction from harness: ""It seems like you're trying to return the final answer, you can do it as follows: <code>final_answer(\""YOUR FINAL ANSWER HERE\"")</code>"" conflicts with earlier 'RESPONSE GUIDELINES' demanding ```python``` code blocks.

71,scicode,1.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The benchmark environment/tooling cannot reliably execute standard Python/Numpy code as written/expected. In the trace, use of the Python matrix-multiplication operator `@` triggers a runtime `NotImplementedError` (“MatMult is not implemented”), which contradicts normal Python/Numpy semantics and is not disclosed in the task. Additionally, the harness intermittently enforces a strict `<code>...</code>` regex wrapper for execution, producing parsing errors unrelated to task logic. These are intrinsic environment/harness deficiencies that can impede capable agents following the prompt. | causation_reasoning: The agent's failure is directly attributable to these environment/harness issues: attempts to validate or run code failed due to the harness regex requirement and due to `@` being unsupported. Later, when solving GADC_rev_coh_inf, the agent produced a correct numpy-based solution, but then the environment's constraints (unsupported `@` and other harness quirks) led to degraded, placeholder, list-based rewrites that removed required functionality (e.g., syspermute/partial_trace/entropy not implemented). Thus the proximate cause of the failed run is the intrinsic execution/parsing incompatibility rather than purely algorithmic misunderstanding. | evidence: 1) Harness parsing failure unrelated to solution correctness: ""Error in code parsing: ... regex pattern <code>(.*?)</code> was not found"".
2) Environment rejects valid Python/Numpy operator: ""NotImplementedError: Binary operation MatMult is not implemented."" (e.g., when calling neg_rev_coh_info and earlier `apply_channel` tests).
3) Agent forced to rewrite away from numpy `@` into `np.dot`: ""The error indicates numpy's `@` operator (`MatMult`) is not supported in the code execution environment. Instead, I should use `np.dot`..."".
4) Final failed submission for GADC_rev_coh_inf devolves into placeholders because of these constraints: in the last assistant code, `syspermute` and `partial_trace` return placeholders (""# ... not implemented here."" / ""return X # placeholder""), and ""The optimizer is not implemented"".",scicode_kiwi_openai_gpt-4_1
12,scicode,1.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The benchmark/evaluation harness appears to require the agent’s final submission to be wrapped in a specific literal format: a <code>...</code> blob that matches the regex pattern <code>(.*?)</code>. However, the task’s “RESPONSE GUIDELINES” instruct the agent to respond in a markdown ```python``` code block, and the tool wrapper later also asks for ```python```. This is a structural mismatch between what the benchmark instructs and what the grader/parser expects, creating an avoidable failure mode unrelated to the algorithmic correctness of the solution code. | causation_reasoning: The run repeatedly fails due to code-parsing errors complaining that the regex <code>(.*?)</code> was not found, even when the underlying function implementations are present and syntactically valid. This indicates the proximate failure is the evaluation apparatus’s strict formatting expectation (missing <code>...</code> wrapper), not the agent’s inability to implement the required functions. When the agent did provide plain ```python``` blocks, the harness often accepted them as “function created”, but the final-step submission repeatedly triggered the regex error, preventing successful completion. | evidence: Multiple occurrences of the harness error:
- ""Error in code parsing: Your code snippet is invalid, because the regex pattern <code>(.*?)</code> was not found in it."" (e.g., after the agent attempted final_answer with code)
