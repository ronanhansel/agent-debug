12,scicode,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: There is an intrinsic scaffolding conflict: mid-run, a system message instructs the model to output ONLY one python function and to remove imports and any non-function code. This is incompatible with the benchmark's normal multi-step format (tools, tests, and later-step implementations) and can prevent correct submission formatting for tasks that expect a full program block or multiple functions. This conflict originates from the benchmark/harness, not the agent. | causation_reasoning: The run is marked failed due to agent-side execution/formatting mistakes rather than an unsolvable benchmark. The agent triggered errors by importing a disallowed module and by producing malformed code strings, both avoidable without changing the benchmark. The agent later produced a valid Numerov function and a valid shoot function. Thus, while a deficiency exists, it was not the proximate cause of failure. | evidence: Deficiency evidence: system message: ""You are a tool that receives a block of text and python code and returns only a python function... Your response should ONLY consist of one python function. Please remove any dependencies or imports..."".
Agent-side errors: ""Code execution failed at line 'import textwrap' due to: InterpreterError: Import of textwrap is not allowed."" and later ""SyntaxError: unterminated string literal... final_answer(f\"""".
Later success indicates not blocked: Numerov function executes (""Last output... <function ...>"") and shoot function tests pass (""Test 1... 3.0 ... caught expected error"").",scicode_sea_openai_gpt-5_2025
2,scicode,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The benchmark task asks to ""simulate the diffraction"" and return a 2D intensity array, but it does not specify key physical/computational details needed to uniquely implement or verify a solution: propagation distance / observation plane location, sampling extents and pixel size for the output grid, coordinate conventions (Cartesian grid size, mapping from given mr2/ne2/mr0 polar discretization to 2D array), and the intended diffraction model (Fraunhofer/Fresnel/angular spectrum, scalar vs. vector, thin-lens phase vs. full lens thickness phase). With only n, d, RL, R0, lambda_ and a few discretization counts, many different implementations are plausible and yield different intensity arrays; thus the problem is intrinsically underspecified for deterministic grading. | causation_reasoning: The agent did not fail due to this underspecification; it failed because it produced no implementation at all and made invalid tool calls with empty code. There is no evidence of the agent attempting a reasonable implementation and being blocked by missing specs or by the evaluation harness rejecting a correct result. The failure is attributable to agent behavior (non-response/incorrect execution), not the benchmark deficiency. | evidence: Agent provided no facts/plan content: ""Here are the facts I know and the plan of action that I will follow to solve the task:\n```\n\n```"". Tool calls were made with empty arguments: ""Calling tools: ... python_interpreter ... 'arguments': ''"" and produced ""Last output from code snippet: None"". No code implementing simulate_light_diffraction was ever produced.",scicode_sea_openai_gpt-5_2025
28,scicode,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: There is a likely formation deficiency: the benchmark’s system post-processor explicitly instructs to ""remove any dependencies or imports"" and output ""ONLY ... one python function"", while the task specification for solutions requires using specific dependencies (""import numpy as np"" and ""from scipy.integrate import simpson"") and earlier says ""Do not include these dependencies at the beginning of your code"" (implying imports may need to be inside the function). This creates a misalignment between what the grader/tooling expects (no imports) and what the task allows/needs (numpy, simpson). Also, simpson is listed as an allowed dependency but is not relevant to either Gaussian propagation or ABCD-q propagation; this suggests some generic/incorrect dependency scaffolding. | causation_reasoning: The agent’s failure was not caused by this deficiency. The agent produced a correct-looking implementation and successfully validated it with a sanity test (focus near f). The trace never shows an evaluation failure due to missing imports, signature mismatch, or harness not finding the function. The run is marked failed in metadata, but there is no evidence the benchmark actually executed and rejected the final function; instead, the agent appears to have completed the task. Therefore, even if a misalignment exists in the scaffolding/tooling instructions, it is not shown to be the proximate cause of the recorded failure. | evidence: Misalignment evidence: system tool instruction: ""Remove any dependencies or imports from the code ... Your response should ONLY consist of one python function."" vs task dependencies: ""Use only the following dependencies... import numpy as np\nfrom scipy.integrate import simpson"" and response guideline: ""Write the complete and executable Python program"".
Agent success evidence: test output shows correct behavior: ""Estimated focus position z_min = 0.2000 m (expected around 0.2 m)"".
No causation evidence: no traceback or grader rejection is shown after the final function; only metadata indicates ""failed"": true without an error trace.",scicode_sea_openai_gpt-5_2025
35,scicode,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The benchmark’s problem statement for generate_quadratic_combinations is intrinsically underspecified: it notes the original description is truncated (""'i,j,k are at least' is incomplete"") and then assumes ""coefficients should be positive integers starting from 1"". Additionally, it does not clarify whether duplicates (degeneracies) should be kept or removed, nor does it specify performance/complexity expectations for large N. This is a formation deficiency because multiple reasonable interpretations exist (include duplicates vs. unique ascending list), and the prompt itself admits truncation. | causation_reasoning: Despite the underspecification, the agent produced a valid implementation for generate_quadratic_combinations and later produced a working absorption implementation that passed numeric tests in the trace. The run is marked failed due to agent-side/tool-usage and formatting issues earlier (e.g., attempting disallowed imports inside python_interpreter and creating unterminated strings), not because the task was impossible or ungradable due to the deficiency. A capable agent could still complete the task under reasonable conventions, as demonstrated by the agent’s later correct code and successful tests. | evidence: Underspecification: ""NOTE: The original description is truncated - 'i,j,k are at least' is incomplete."" and ""coefficients should be positive integers starting from 1."" 
Agent/tool errors: ""Error: Code execution failed at line 'from python_interpreter import python_interpreter' due to: InterpreterError: Import from python_interpreter is not allowed.""; ""SyntaxError: unterminated triple-quoted string literal""; ""SyntaxError: unterminated string literal"". 
Agent later succeeds in core logic: unit test output ""Test result for x=y=z=1, N=5: [ 3.  6.  9. 11. 12.] Matches expected: True"" and absorption tests: ""Descending order: True ... Close to expected: True"".",scicode_sea_openai_gpt-5_2025
52,scicode,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: There is evidence of task/scaffold mismatch in the harness: after the user provided the correct code for `SolveSchroedinger`, the conversation unexpectedly pivoted to a different ""next step"" (implementing `Shoot`, then `FindBoundStates`) even though the stated task at that point was to implement `SolveSchroedinger`. This indicates the benchmark/evaluation context may be misaligned or concatenating multiple subtasks incorrectly. Additionally, a system instruction later says to ""returns only a python function"" and ""remove any dependencies or imports,"" which can conflict with earlier dependency guidance; this suggests inconsistent evaluation scaffolding. | causation_reasoning: The agent's failure in the recorded run is not shown as a concrete test/runtime failure due to the benchmark deficiency; rather, the agent introduced its own errors, including outputting the wrong thing to `final_answer` (it wrapped code in a string and called `final_answer(function_code)`; later it called `final_answer(FindBoundStates)` instead of emitting a code block). Also, earlier a SyntaxError arose from the agent's malformed triple-quoted string in a tool call. These are agent-side mistakes and would cause failure even if the benchmark scaffolding were perfect. | evidence: 1) Misalignment/pivot: after solving `SolveSchroedinger`, the trace shifts: ""As part of the shooting algorithm to be used later... def Shoot(En, R, l, y0):"" and later to `FindBoundStates`, despite the earlier task being `SolveSchroedinger`.
2) Conflicting system instruction: ""You are a tool that receives a block of text and python code and returns only a python function... remove any dependencies or imports"".
3) Agent-caused syntax error: ""SyntaxError: unterminated triple-quoted string literal"".
4) Agent output mistake: it constructs `function_code = """""" ... """"""` and then does `final_answer(function_code)`; later: ""I will ... return the function via final_answer"" and calls `final_answer(FindBoundStates)`.",scicode_sea_openai_gpt-5_2025
58,scicode,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The overall benchmark interaction contains intrinsic inconsistencies that can mislead an agent: (a) the conversation repeatedly switches to 'New task' with different required functions (eos_press_from_rho, eos_rho_from_press, eos_eps_from_press, tov_RHS), and at one point a system message requests producing only a single python function but the assistant instead outputs an unrelated facts survey for a different function. (b) The TOV step instructs 'Use the functions eps_from_press and rho_from_press' while earlier provided functions are named eos_eps_from_press and eos_rho_from_press, creating an internal naming mismatch. These are formation issues in the benchmark materials and scaffolding that could confuse integration expectations. | causation_reasoning: Despite the above issues, the agent successfully implemented and validated the correct tov_RHS logic with tests. The recorded 'failed': true occurs at the end because the agent ultimately outputs the wrong function (it reverts to planning/implementing eos_press_from_rho) rather than delivering tov_RHS, and earlier it also triggered SyntaxError by embedding unterminated triple-quoted strings in tool-call code. Those are agent-side mistakes (mis-following the final requested step / tool-call formatting), not blockers that would prevent a capable agent from succeeding. The benchmark deficiencies were present but not the proximate cause of failure here. | evidence: Benchmark inconsistencies: 'Use the functions `eps_from_press` and `rho_from_press`' while earlier functions are 'def eos_eps_from_press(...)' and 'def eos_rho_from_press(...)'.
Agent-side errors: tool-call parsing failures: 'SyntaxError: unterminated triple-quoted string literal ... final_answer(""""""'.
Agent produced correct tov_RHS earlier: 'Interior test: (-384.687..., 2513.27..., 128.22...)' and later shows the full tov_RHS implementation.
Final mismatch: agent ends by producing facts/plan and code for eos_press_from_rho ('We need to write a function that computes pressure given density... def eos_press_from_rho...'), not the requested tov_RHS deliverable, leading to run failure.",scicode_sea_openai_gpt-5_2025
63,scicode,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The benchmark environment (python_interpreter) enforces a restricted import allowlist that excludes some standard-library modules (e.g., types, textwrap). This is an intrinsic constraint of the evaluation apparatus that can impede agents who follow the prompt’s instruction to “test using the python interpreter” and naturally reach for standard-library helpers (e.g., textwrap.dedent) while building test scaffolding. The task prompt itself does not warn that common stdlib imports are disallowed, creating an implicit assumption mismatch between typical Python and the sandboxed interpreter. | causation_reasoning: Although this deficiency exists, it did not ultimately cause the run to fail. The agent successfully implemented and validated the requested construct_matrix function after avoiding disallowed imports, and produced a correct final code block. The earlier failures were due to the agent’s choice to import disallowed modules during testing (types/textwrap) and a self-inflicted quoting/syntax issue inside a raw string test harness, not an unsolvable benchmark condition. A capable agent can complete the task within the constraints by not using disallowed imports and by not embedding conflicting triple quotes; indeed, the agent later did so and tests passed. | evidence: Interpreter restriction errors: ""Import from types is not allowed"" and later ""Code execution failed at line 'from textwrap import dedent' due to: InterpreterError: Import from textwrap is not allowed."" Also agent-introduced syntax issue: ""Code parsing failed on line 7 due to: SyntaxError: invalid syntax ... code_to_run = r''' ... def construct_matrix... '''Constructs..."". Despite this, success evidence appears later: ""Stdout: Shape: (5, 5) ... Assertions passed."" and the agent provides a coherent final implementation of construct_matrix.",scicode_sea_openai_gpt-5_2025
71,scicode,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The benchmark text contains a structural inconsistency: it claims a mismatch between function headers and how tests call them (e.g., notes about missing parameters), which is a formation deficiency because it can mislead an agent about the required signature. In this trace, the task descriptions explicitly include such notes (e.g., header vs tests for ket and tensor). | causation_reasoning: Despite the misalignment existing in the written description, it did not cause the observed failure. The agent successfully implemented and validated `tensor(*args)` with the correct variadic signature and produced a correct-looking solution. The run is marked failed, but there is no evidence in the trace of an evaluation-time blockage stemming from the header mismatch; instead the trace derails into unrelated content (e.g., switching to `syspermute`/`partial_trace`) and includes formatting/interaction issues (tool calls with empty code, contradictory system constraint about outputting only one function). The failure appears due to agent/process confusion and off-task transitions, not an intrinsic impossibility in the benchmark. | evidence: Problem note: ""**NOTE**: Function header has no parameters but test cases call tensor([0,1],[0,1])..."" and earlier: ""**NOTE**: Function header only has 'dim' parameter but test cases call ket(2, 0)..."". Agent successfully tests tensor: ""v equals expected: True"" and outputs a valid `def tensor(*args): ...` implementation. Later the interaction shifts: assistant outputs facts/plans for `syspermute`/`partial_trace` unrelated to the stated tensor task, and there are multiple empty tool calls: `python_interpreter` with `""arguments"": """"`.",scicode_sea_openai_gpt-5_2025
80,scicode,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The benchmark tasks themselves are well-formed and solvable: implement dist (minimum image) and later E_ij (truncated/shifted LJ) and E_pot (pairwise sum using dist and E_ij). The function headers are clear, dependencies are reasonable (and not actually required for these implementations), and nothing in the prompt makes the tasks impossible. The agent ultimately produced correct standalone implementations for dist, E_ij, and E_pot in plain python. | causation_reasoning: The run failure is driven by the agent's repeated tool-call / string-quoting mistakes when attempting to embed code blocks and call final_answer from inside python_interpreter snippets, producing multiple SyntaxError: unterminated triple-quoted string literal. These are agent-side formatting/implementation issues (explicitly excluded by the rubric). When the agent stopped trying to embed triple-quoted output and simply emitted the function in the required ```python format, the code was correct. Thus no intrinsic benchmark deficiency caused the failure. | evidence: Multiple tool parsing errors due to agent quoting/formatting: e.g. ""SyntaxError: invalid syntax ... function_code = r'''\ndef dist... '''Calculate..."" and ""SyntaxError: unterminated triple-quoted string literal ... final_code = \""\""\"""" and later ""SyntaxError: unterminated triple-quoted string literal ... final_answer(f\""\""\"""".
