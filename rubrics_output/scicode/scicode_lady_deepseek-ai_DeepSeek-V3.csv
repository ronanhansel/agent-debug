12,scicode,1.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The benchmark input provides no actual Python code or function signature to transform—only an error message asking to ""implement the required function manually"". The system instruction forbids changing functionality and requires returning ""ONLY ... one python function"" extracted/cleaned from the provided code. With no function definition, name, parameters, or intended behavior, the task is intrinsically underspecified: multiple arbitrary stubs could satisfy the format, but none can be verified as the intended required implementation because the benchmark never states what the function should do. | causation_reasoning: The agent failed because the prompt contained insufficient information to implement the required function. The agent oscillated between arbitrary stubs (e.g., `required_function()` with `pass`, later `process_text(...)` raising NotImplementedError), demonstrating that the missing specification forced guessing. Any agent would be unable to deterministically produce the intended function implementation given only the error text, so the formation deficiency is the proximate cause of failure. | evidence: User input contains only: ""# Error occurred: This method must be implemented in child classes\n# Please implement the required function manually"" with no code/template. System requires: ""receives a block of text and python code and returns only a python function"" and ""Do NOT add or change any functionality inside the functions"". Agent outputs are guesses: `def required_function(): pass` and later `def process_text(text, **kwargs): raise NotImplementedError(...)`, showing lack of determinable target.",scicode_lady_deepseek-ai_DeepSeek-V3
2,scicode,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The benchmark input provides no actual code, function signature, or class context—only the message ""This method must be implemented in child classes"" and ""Please implement the required function manually"". Without the missing parent class/interface or the required method name/signature, the task is intrinsically underspecified: there is no uniquely correct function to implement, and any agent would have to guess what function is expected. | causation_reasoning: Although the task is underspecified, the agent's failure in this run is attributable to producing an arbitrary function name and behavior (a bare NotImplementedError) rather than reconstructing the likely intended missing method from any provided scaffold (none was present in the trace). The trace does not show the evaluation harness rejecting a correct-but-unrecognized solution due to misaligned templates; it shows the agent responding to an error message with a generic stub. Thus, the failure cannot be confidently attributed to a benchmark formation deficiency as the proximate cause, even though one exists. | evidence: User input contains only: ""# Error occurred: This method must be implemented in child classes\n# Please implement the required function manually"" with no signature/template. Agent output: ""def implemented_in_child_classes():\n    raise NotImplementedError"" which is a guessed function name not grounded in any provided interface.",scicode_lady_deepseek-ai_DeepSeek-V3
28,scicode,1.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The benchmark input provides no actual python code or function signature to transform—only two comment lines describing an error. The system instruction requires returning ""ONLY consist of one python function"" and to ""Do NOT add or change any functionality inside the functions,"" but there is no function given to preserve. This makes the task structurally underspecified/impossible to complete correctly because any produced function would necessarily be invented (name/signature/body), violating the 'do not add/change functionality' constraint. | causation_reasoning: The agent failed because the task input lacks the necessary information (the missing method name, signature, and intended behavior) to generate the required function without fabricating content. The agent had to guess (e.g., creating `required_function` and raising NotImplementedError), which is not grounded in provided code. Thus the failure is attributable to the benchmark's missing/underspecified formation rather than an agent implementation mistake. | evidence: User input contains only: ""# Error occurred: This method must be implemented in child classes\n# Please implement the required function manually"" with no code.

35,scicode,1.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The benchmark input contains no actual code or function signature to transform—only two comment lines describing an error (“This method must be implemented in child classes”). Since the tool task is to sanitize and return an existing function without changing functionality, the absence of any provided function/body makes the task ill-posed: there is nothing to extract/clean, and any produced function must be invented, violating “Do NOT add or change any functionality inside the functions.” | causation_reasoning: The agent failed because it had to guess and fabricate a placeholder function (`required_function`) and behavior (raising NotImplementedError) in order to return something, which is not derivable from the input. Any agent would face the same impossible situation: either output nothing (violating “ONLY consist of one python function”) or invent code not present in the input (violating the non-modification constraint). Thus the intrinsic underspecification/missing code directly caused failure. | evidence: User input provides only: ""# Error occurred: This method must be implemented in child classes\n# Please implement the required function manually"" with no code template or function to rewrite. System constraints include: ""Do NOT add or change any functionality inside the functions"" and ""Your response should ONLY consist of one python function.""

52,scicode,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The task instructions are coherent and feasible: output exactly one Python function in a ```python``` block, remove imports/extraneous code, and comment out non-Python lines. There is no contradictory requirement or missing dependency that would prevent a capable agent from complying. The user input contains no actual code besides comments, but the benchmark still remains solvable because the agent can legally return a minimal valid function (e.g., a stub) following the formatting rules. | causation_reasoning: The failure is attributable to the agent's output content/format relative to the tool's requirements, not to any benchmark formation issue. The agent returned a function containing a comment line inside it (""# This method must be implemented in child classes""), despite the system instruction to remove comments. Additionally, the agent fabricated content (a NotImplementedError function) without any provided code to transform, which is an agent-side decision rather than a benchmark impossibility. | evidence: System instruction: ""Remove any comments, extra markdown, or stray text"" and ""Your response should ONLY consist of one python function."" User provided only comments: ""# Error occurred: This method must be implemented in child classes\n# Please implement the required function manually"".

58,scicode,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The task as presented is solvable: the system instruction requests returning exactly one Python function in a ```python code block, with no imports and no extraneous text. The user provides only an error message and a request to implement a required function; producing a stub function is feasible and consistent with the cleaning/extraction instruction. There is no contradiction or impossible requirement in the benchmark materials. | causation_reasoning: The agent’s failure is not due to a benchmark deficiency but due to the agent’s own behavior/output. The agent initially produced a compliant function, but then continued emitting extensive non-code reasoning text instead of outputting only a single python function as required. This violates the format constraints and would cause evaluation failure independent of any benchmark issue. | evidence: System requires: ""Your response should ONLY consist of one python function... Your response should be in the format of ```python ```"". Agent did output a function: ""```python\ndef required_function():\n    raise NotImplementedError(...)\n```"" but then continued with non-code: ""<think> Okay, the user wants me to generate..."" and further long reasoning blocks, violating the 'only one python function' requirement.",scicode_lady_deepseek-ai_DeepSeek-V3
63,scicode,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The task instructions are internally consistent: output exactly one Python function in a ```python code block, with no imports or extra top-level code, and preserve functionality. The user input provides only commented error text, so a reasonable compliant output is a stub or a NotImplementedError-raising function. Nothing in the benchmark specification makes the task impossible for a capable agent; it is solvable by producing a single valid function definition matching the constraints. | causation_reasoning: The failure is attributable to the agent producing multiple separate code blocks/functions and extensive non-code reasoning text, violating the system constraint that the response should ONLY consist of one python function. This is an agent instruction-following/formatting failure, not a benchmark formation deficiency. | evidence: System constraint: ""Your response should ONLY consist of one python function"" and ""Your response should be in the format of ```python ```"".

The provided input contains no actual code to transform—only a textual error message—so any valid single-function stub would satisfy the structural requirement. There is no contradiction or impossible requirement imposed by the task setup itself. | causation_reasoning: The run failed due to the agent not following the instruction ""Do NOT add or change any functionality inside the functions"" and likely other formatting/constraint issues (e.g., inventing function names and behavior). The agent produced arbitrary stubs (e.g., raising NotImplementedError) without any provided original function to preserve, which is an agent-side compliance/interpretation failure rather than a benchmark formation deficiency. | evidence: User input provided only: ""# Error occurred: This method must be implemented in child classes\n# Please implement the required function manually"" (no function/code to clean).

80,scicode,1.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The benchmark input provides no actual Python code or function signature to transform—only two comment lines describing an error (“This method must be implemented in child classes”) and a request to implement something. Given the system instruction to 'receive a block of text and python code and return only a python function' and 'Do NOT add or change any functionality inside the functions', the task is ill-formed: there is no function to extract/clean, and implementing a missing method would require inventing functionality and a signature that are not present. This is an intrinsic deficiency in the provided task materials (missing required code/context). | causation_reasoning: The agent failed because the prompt content is insufficient and contradictory: it asks for a single cleaned function without altering functionality, while the only provided content is an error message demanding an implementation. With no function name, parameters, or intended behavior, any agent would have to guess.
