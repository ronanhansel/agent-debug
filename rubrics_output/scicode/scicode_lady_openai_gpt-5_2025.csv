2,scicode,1.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The benchmark input provides no code, no function signature, and no specification of what function to implement. The system instruction requires returning exactly one Python function without changing functionality, but there is no source code/function body to transform and no required interface described.

Since the only user content is an error message (“This method must be implemented in child classes”) with no accompanying class/method definition or expected behavior, any produced function would be arbitrary and unverifiable.

28,scicode,1.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The benchmark input provides no functional specification, signature, or expected behavior to implement—only an error message stating a method must be implemented in child classes.

This failure stems directly from the benchmark's lack of actionable requirements; even a perfect agent cannot infer the correct implementation from the provided text alone. If the benchmark had provided the missing method signature/contract, the agent could attempt a real implementation. | evidence: User input contains only: ""# Error occurred: This method must be implemented in child classes\n# Please implement the required function manually"" with no additional code/context.

35,scicode,1.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The benchmark input provides no actual code, function signature, or task specification beyond a generic error message. The system instruction requires returning exactly one python function while not changing functionality, but there is no source code or described required method to implement. This is an intrinsic formation deficiency because the task is underspecified and provides insufficient materials for any agent to produce a correct, evaluable function. | causation_reasoning: The agent failed because the benchmark supplied no implementable target (no class, no method name, no signature, no expected behavior). With only the message ""This method must be implemented in child classes"", any produced function would be arbitrary and unlikely to match hidden tests. Thus the deficiency (missing/empty scaffolding and specification) is the proximate cause of failure, not an agent-side reasoning or formatting error. | evidence: User content contains only: ""# Error occurred: This method must be implemented in child classes\n# Please implement the required function manually"" and provides no code/template.

52,scicode,1.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The benchmark input provides no code, no class/function scaffold, and no description of the required method beyond a generic error message. The system instruction requires producing exactly one valid Python function without changing functionality, but there is no source function to extract or any specification (name, signature, expected behavior) to implement. This is an intrinsic underspecification/scaffolding failure: a capable agent cannot infer what to implement from the provided materials. | causation_reasoning: The run failed because the task materials contain only an error notice (“This method must be implemented in child classes”) and do not include the method that needs implementation or any requirements. With no target function/signature, any agent output would be guesswork and likely rejected; thus the intrinsic deficiency directly caused the failure. | evidence: User input contains only: ""# Error occurred: This method must be implemented in child classes\n# Please implement the required function manually"" and provides no code/template, method name, signature, or expected behavior, while the system requires: ""returns only a python function"" and ""Do NOT add or change any functionality inside the functions"".",scicode_lady_openai_gpt-5_2025

This is an intrinsic formation deficiency because any agent would be forced to guess. | causation_reasoning: The agent failed because it could not implement a real required method given the complete absence of requirements. It produced a placeholder function with a pass, which is the only safe action under underspecification but would not satisfy any hidden tests expecting specific behavior.

71,scicode,1.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The benchmark input provides no actual code, function signature, expected behavior, or context beyond an error message stating that a method must be implemented in child classes.

As a result, the agent produced arbitrary placeholder implementations (return None / raise NotImplementedError / pass), none of which can be validated as correct.
