12,scicode,1.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The benchmark input provides no actual code, signature, required behavior, class context, or tests—only an error message stating a method must be implemented. Without the parent class, expected method name, return type, and semantics, the task is structurally underspecified: many incompatible implementations could be “correct,” and an agent cannot infer what to implement. This is an intrinsic formation deficiency because the prompt itself lacks the necessary specification for any agent to deterministically produce the expected function. | causation_reasoning: The agent failed because it was forced to guess the function/method name and behavior (cycling through multiple arbitrary stubs and different names). Given the absence of required interface details, no agent could reliably implement the intended method, so the underspecification directly caused the failure rather than an agent-side logic bug. | evidence: User input contains only: ""# Error occurred: This method must be implemented in child classes\n# Please implement the required function manually"" with no additional code/template. Agent responses show guessing and changing targets: ""def required_function..."", then ""def implemented_method..."", ""def required_function... raise NotImplementedError(...)"", ""def implemented_function..."", ""def required_method(self, *args, **kwargs): ..."" indicating no defined required name/behavior was available.",scicode_lady_openai_o3_2025
2,scicode,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The task prompt provides only an error message ('This method must be implemented in child classes') and a request to implement the required function manually. There is no contradictory requirement, missing dependency, or template/evaluation misalignment evident in the trace itself. A capable agent could implement an actual function body if additional context/specification were provided; however, in this trace the benchmark is simply asking for implementation without giving any functional requirements. That is insufficient for solving a real task, but from the provided interaction it appears the agent was expected to replace a placeholder, and the framework instructions about output format are clear and satisfiable. | causation_reasoning: The failure is attributable to the agent returning a stub that still raises NotImplementedError, i.e., not implementing the method as requested. There is no evidence the benchmark prevented implementation or that any environment/template issue blocked success. The agent did not attempt a substantive implementation and instead reproduced the original error condition. | evidence: User message: ""# Error occurred: This method must be implemented in child classes\n# Please implement the required function manually"".

This is intrinsically underspecified: there is no way to know which method is required or what it should do. This constitutes a formation deficiency in the task specification because it lacks the minimal information needed to produce a uniquely correct implementation. | causation_reasoning: Although the task is underspecified, the agent's failure is primarily due to violating the system instruction that the response must contain ONLY one python function. The agent produced three separate code blocks/functions (required_function, required_method, example_method). That formatting/constraint violation would fail even if the benchmark were better specified, so the deficiency did not proximately cause this specific failure. | evidence: Underspecification: user message contains only ""# Error occurred: This method must be implemented in child classes\n# Please implement the required function manually"" with no function name/signature.

35,scicode,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: No intrinsic benchmark formation deficiency is evidenced in the provided trace. The system instruction is clear: output ONLY one Python function, with no extra text. The prompt from the user is minimal but indicates a NotImplementedError placeholder and asks to implement the required function manually; this is solvable within the constraints by providing a single concrete function implementation (even a stub) that does not violate the “only one function” requirement. There is no indication of contradictory requirements, missing dependencies, or template/evaluation misalignment that would block any agent. | causation_reasoning: The failure stems from the agent violating the explicit output constraint by providing two separate code blocks/functions. This is an agent-side formatting/compliance error (multiple functions) rather than a benchmark deficiency. A compliant response with a single function would satisfy the system constraint; therefore no intrinsic deficiency caused the failure. | evidence: System: ""Your response should ONLY consist of one python function.""

This is underspecified: there is not enough information to derive what function should be returned, what it should be named, or what semantics are required. A well-formed task would include the abstract base class/interface, the method name/signature, and expected behavior/tests. | causation_reasoning: Despite the underspecification, the agent's failure in this run is primarily due to violating the system instruction to output ONLY one python function. The agent emitted multiple separate code blocks/functions across messages (execute, required_method, required_function twice, implemented_function). That is an agent capability/formatting/compliance failure rather than an unavoidable benchmark deficiency. Even with clearer specs, this behavior would still fail the evaluator expecting a single function. | evidence: System instruction: ""Your response should ONLY consist of one python function.""
