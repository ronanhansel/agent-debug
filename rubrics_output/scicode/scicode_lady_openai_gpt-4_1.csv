12,scicode,1.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The benchmark input provides no actual function signature, required behavior, or code context—only an error message stating a method must be implemented. With no class/interface name, expected return values, argument requirements, or testable specification, there is no uniquely solvable task. Any agent would have to guess what to implement, making the task intrinsically underspecified. | causation_reasoning: The agent failed because the benchmark did not specify what 'required function' should be, leading the agent to produce arbitrary placeholder implementations (varying names and signatures). Since the evaluation likely expects a specific function/method with a specific signature/behavior, the absence of that information is the proximate cause: even a perfect agent cannot derive the correct implementation from the provided input alone. | evidence: User input contains only: ""# Error occurred: This method must be implemented in child classes\n# Please implement the required function manually"". The agent then guesses multiple inconsistent implementations and names (e.g., ""def required_function(*args, **kwargs): ..."", ""def required_method(self): ...""), indicating there was no concrete spec to follow.",scicode_lady_openai_gpt-4_1
2,scicode,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The benchmark prompt is structurally coherent: it asks the agent to output exactly one Python function and provides minimal input indicating a missing abstract/required method. There is no contradiction, missing dependency, template misalignment, or underspecification inherent to the task description that would prevent a capable agent from producing an acceptable function implementation. | causation_reasoning: The agent failed due to its own choice to return a function that only raises NotImplementedError, which does not satisfy the instruction to ""implement the required function manually"" (i.e., provide a concrete implementation rather than preserving the unimplemented behavior). This is an agent capability/behavior issue, not a benchmark formation deficiency. | evidence: User input: ""# Error occurred: This method must be implemented in child classes\n# Please implement the required function manually"". Agent output: ""def required_method(self, *args, **kwargs):\n    # This method must be implemented in child classes\n    raise NotImplementedError(\""This method must be implemented in child classes\"")"".

28,scicode,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The benchmark instructions are clear: return exactly one valid Python function, remove imports/dependencies, and comment out non-Python text. The user input provides only an error message and asks to implement the required function manually. There is no contradiction or missing information imposed by the benchmark itself; a capable agent can comply by outputting a single function definition. | causation_reasoning: The agent failed due to its own output violating the benchmark's required format/constraints: it produced two separate code blocks/functions across two assistant messages instead of a single function response. This is an agent formatting/compliance issue, explicitly excluded from being considered a benchmark formation deficiency. | evidence: System requirement: ""Your response should ONLY consist of one python function."" Agent outputs twice: first message includes ```python\ndef required_method(self, *args, **kwargs):\n    raise NotImplementedError(...)\n``` and then a second message includes another ```python\ndef required_method(self):\n    # This method must be implemented in child classes\n    raise NotImplementedError(...)\n```.",scicode_lady_openai_gpt-4_1
35,scicode,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: No intrinsic benchmark formation deficiency is evident from the trace. The system instruction is clear: return ONLY one python function, remove comments/imports, and format as a single ```python``` block. The user input provides only an error message indicating a required method must be implemented, which is sufficient to produce a placeholder implementation. Nothing in the prompt creates an impossible or contradictory requirement for a capable agent. | causation_reasoning: The failure is attributable to the agent not following the output constraints (multiple separate code blocks / multiple functions and inclusion of a comment in the third attempt), not to any flaw in the benchmark. A compliant output (exactly one function in one code block, no extra blocks) was possible. | evidence: System: ""Your response should ONLY consist of one python function."" and ""Your response should be in the format of ```python ```"". Agent produced multiple outputs: first code block defining required_method, then another defining required_function, then a third redefining required_method with an inline comment (""# This method must be implemented in child classes""). Metadata shows ""failed"": true with ""entry_count"": 4, consistent with repeated noncompliant attempts.",scicode_lady_openai_gpt-4_1
52,scicode,1.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The benchmark input provides no actual code, function signature, class context, or required name beyond the generic error text. The only user content is an error message stating a method must be implemented in child classes, but it does not specify what the required function/method is called, what parameters it takes, or what behavior it should have. This makes it impossible for any agent to implement the intended required method/function correctly, because the task is missing the essential specification that would tie the implementation to the evaluator's expectations. | causation_reasoning: The agent failed because, lacking the needed specification, it could only guess at function names and signatures (e.g., 'required_method', 'required_function') and simply re-raise NotImplementedError, which would not satisfy an evaluator expecting a concrete implementation with a specific name/signature/behavior. Since the prompt itself contains no actionable requirements besides the error message, even a perfect agent could not infer the correct implementation. Thus the intrinsic underspecification is the proximate cause of failure. | evidence: User input contains only: ""# Error occurred: This method must be implemented in child classes\n# Please implement the required function manually"" with no function/class name or signature. Agent outputs are guesses: ""def required_method(self, *args, **kwargs): ..."" / ""def required_function(): ..."" and all raise NotImplementedError, indicating absence of required spec to implement anything concrete.",scicode_lady_openai_gpt-4_1
58,scicode,1.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The benchmark input provides no actual code context, signature, or class structure to implement—only an error message string. The system instruction requires returning exactly one python function and not changing functionality, but there is no source function body or required interface to preserve. This is an intrinsic formation deficiency: the task is underspecified and lacks the necessary template/scaffold for a correct implementation to be determined or verified. | causation_reasoning: The agent failed because it had to guess what function to implement (name and signature) and produced multiple different candidate functions across messages, violating the 'ONLY consist of one python function' requirement. With only the message 'This method must be implemented in child classes' and no additional context, any agent would be forced to invent an interface, making failure effectively inevitable under the evaluation constraints. | evidence: User input contains only: ""# Error occurred: This method must be implemented in child classes\n# Please implement the required function manually"" with no code/template. System requires: ""Your response should ONLY consist of one python function"" and ""Do NOT add or change any functionality inside the functions.""

63,scicode,1.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The benchmark input provides no actual code template, class context, required function name, signature, or expected behavior beyond a generic error string (“This method must be implemented in child classes”). With only that message, there is no well-defined task: multiple incompatible outputs could be considered plausible (e.g., raising NotImplementedError, implementing a real method, using self vs no self, accepting args/kwargs). Any agent is forced to guess what function to output, so the task as presented is intrinsically underspecified. | causation_reasoning: The agent failed because it could not infer the required function/method identity or implementation from the provided input. It produced several different placeholder functions (varying name/signature and behavior), none grounded in a specified target. Since the benchmark did not supply the necessary information to implement the ""required function manually,"" failure is attributable to the formation deficiency rather than agent reasoning. | evidence: User input contains only: ""# Error occurred: This method must be implemented in child classes\n# Please implement the required function manually"" with no function name, signature, or surrounding code. Agent responses vary: ""def required_function(): raise NotImplementedError(...)""; ""def required_method(self): ...""; ""def required_method(self, *args, **kwargs): ...""; and a ""pass"" implementation—showing the task lacks determinative specification.",scicode_lady_openai_gpt-4_1
71,scicode,1.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The benchmark input provides no actual code context, function signature, class name, or required behavior beyond a generic error message. It says to ""implement the required function manually"" but does not specify which function, its required name, parameters, return type, or expected semantics. This makes it impossible for any agent to produce the uniquely correct function expected by an evaluator, since multiple incompatible implementations/names are possible and there is no grounding information to infer the correct one. | causation_reasoning: The agent failed because the task is underspecified: it tried multiple plausible stub functions with different names/signatures (e.g., required_method, method_to_be_implemented, required_function) and behaviors (raise NotImplementedError vs pass). Without the missing specification, no agent can know what the evaluator expects, so the failure is attributable to the benchmark's formation deficiency rather than agent reasoning or implementation. | evidence: User input contains only: ""# Error occurred: This method must be implemented in child classes\n# Please implement the required function manually"" with no further details. Agent produced several different guesses: ""def required_method(self, *args, **kwargs): ..."", ""def method_to_be_implemented(self, *args, **kwargs): ..."", and ""def required_function(): ..."", indicating the required target is not defined by the prompt.",scicode_lady_openai_gpt-4_1
80,scicode,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The benchmark input provides no actual code context, required signature, or function name—only an error message: ""This method must be implemented in child classes"" and ""Please implement the required function manually"". Without the parent class/interface, expected method name, arguments, and required behavior, the task is underspecified and does not allow a uniquely correct implementation to be derived from the prompt alone. | causation_reasoning: Despite underspecification, the agent still could have complied with the system instruction to output exactly one python function and chosen a single consistent stub. Instead, the trace shows multiple successive function outputs (required_method, required_function, method_to_be_implemented), violating the instruction ""Your response should ONLY consist of one python function."" This formatting/constraint violation is an agent error and is sufficient to explain failure independent of the benchmark underspecification. | evidence: User input contains only: ""# Error occurred: This method must be implemented in child classes\n# Please implement the required function manually"" (no signature/name).
