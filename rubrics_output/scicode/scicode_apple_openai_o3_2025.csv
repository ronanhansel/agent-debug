35,scicode,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The benchmark task is solvable as stated: implement absorption(mr,a,b,c,N) using provided physics formulas and the previously defined helper generate_quadratic_combinations. Dependencies (numpy, itertools) are available and consistent with the requested approach. While the prompt notes an original truncation (“i,j,k are at least”), it immediately clarifies the intended interpretation (“positive integers starting from 1”), removing underspecification. No template/harness contradiction is inherent: the required output is a python code block defining the function, which is possible. | causation_reasoning: The run failure is attributable to agent-side issues, not benchmark formation. The agent at one point responded with plain text instead of a required ```python``` block, triggering a parsing error. Later, the agent also violated the guideline “Do not attempt to write nested functions when trying to debug your function” by introducing an inner helper function inside absorption, and returned a Python list rather than explicitly a NumPy array. Any of these can fail evaluation, but they are implementation/formatting choices by the agent rather than unavoidable barriers created by the benchmark. | evidence: Formatting/parsing failure: user error message: ""Error in code parsing: Your code snippet is invalid, because the regex pattern ```python(.*?)``` was not found in it. Here is your code snippet: The function is successfully defined..."" Agent introduced nested function in final attempt: ""def absorption(...): ... def _generate_quadratic_combinations(...):"" and returns a list: ""return sorted(lambda_nm, reverse=True)"" despite output spec: ""The output is a numpy array...""",scicode_apple_openai_o3_2025
28,scicode,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: There are intrinsic issues in the benchmark/task packaging: (1) The prompt explicitly says ""Use only the following dependencies ... Do not include these dependencies at the beginning of your code."" yet the agent-facing evaluation later involves a system step that strips imports and expects functions to rely on preexisting imports. This is a confusing/contradictory scaffolding signal for how imports should be handled. (2) The transcript shows clear cross-task contamination: at one point the assistant suddenly outputs an ""Updated facts survey"" about a different function (`gaussian_beam_through_lens`) while the active task was still `propagate_gaussian_beam`, indicating the benchmark conversation structure can mix tasks and mislead an agent. These are formation/scaffolding problems, though not necessarily fatal because a careful agent can still comply by outputting only the function body and relying on hidden imports. | causation_reasoning: The run ultimately failed due to an agent-side formatting/output error, not because compliance was impossible. The framework error explicitly states the regex code fence was missing because the agent output stray text: `0.77````, which violates the required ```python ... ``` pattern. This is a recoverable formatting mistake (explicitly excluded by the rubric) and unrelated to the intrinsic scaffolding issues. The agent later produced correctly fenced code multiple times, indicating the task was solvable in the environment and not blocked by the benchmark’s deficiencies. | evidence: Formatting failure: ""Error in code parsing: Your code snippet is invalid, because the regex pattern ```python(.*?)``` was not found in it. Here is your code snippet:\n0.77```"". Conflicting instruction about imports: ""Use only the following dependencies... Do not include these dependencies at the beginning of your code.""

We have to write a function named `gaussian_beam_through_lens`..."" while earlier task was `propagate_gaussian_beam`.",scicode_apple_openai_o3_2025
52,scicode,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The task is well-formed and solvable with the stated dependencies. Each step clearly specifies the required function header and behavior (Schroed_deriv, SolveSchroedinger with simpson normalization, Shoot extrapolation, FindBoundStates bracketing+root finding). The environment supports required SciPy components (integrate.solve_ivp, integrate.simpson, optimize.brentq) and numpy. Minor ambiguities (e.g., docstring saying 'ur: float' though it should be an array) are not structural blockers; a correct solution can still be implemented and graded. No template/harness contradiction is evident: the harness seems to accept function definitions and returns 'create_function...new_func' indicating successful parsing/compilation, not a benchmark defect. | causation_reasoning: Since no intrinsic benchmark deficiency is evidenced, the failure is not attributable to formation issues. The trace shows repeated successful code compilation ('create_function...new_func') rather than systematic runtime/import/template failures. The eventual run is marked failed, but the transcript does not show an evaluator error arising from impossible requirements; instead it suggests agent-side issues (e.g., drifting across multiple tasks, inconsistent equation sign conventions in earlier iterations, adding/removing imports contrary to instructions, and producing extra non-requested content at times). Without evidence of an unsatisfiable spec or harness misalignment, causation is agent-side rather than benchmark-side. | evidence: 1) Harness accepts code repeatedly: ""Last output from code snippet: <function create_function.<locals>.new_func ...>"" appears after implementations of Schroed_deriv, SolveSchroedinger, Shoot, FindBoundStates, indicating the environment can compile these functions.
2) Requirements are internally consistent: ""normalize the result using Simpson's rule ... use scipy.integrate.simpson"" and agent uses integrate.simpson.
3) No trace of structural exceptions like missing libraries/incorrect signatures forced by prompt; functions can be written with allowed deps (numpy/scipy.integrate/scipy.optimize).
4) Final failure marker is generic: ""<|agent run metadata|> ... \""failed\"": true"" with no accompanying benchmark-side error indicating an intrinsic deficiency.",scicode_apple_openai_o3_2025
58,scicode,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: There is a mild formation deficiency: the benchmark's ""DEPENDENCIES"" section says ""Do not include these dependencies at the beginning of your code"", yet later steps (e.g., `tov` integration) inherently require `np` unless the agent hardcodes constants or uses pure-Python lists. Additionally, the prompt text sometimes references function names inconsistently (e.g., ""Use the functions `eps_from_press` and `rho_from_press`"" while the provided functions are `eos_eps_from_press` and `eos_rho_from_press`). These issues could confuse agents, but they are not inherently blocking because a correct solution can be written without top-level imports (e.g., use `pi` constant and avoid `np`) and the correct function names are shown in code snippets. | causation_reasoning: The run failed due to an agent output formatting/parsing error, not due to the benchmark. The agent at least twice responded with plain text instead of a ```python ...``` fenced code block, triggering the harness regex failure. After the harness clarified the formatting requirement, the agent was able to provide correctly fenced code. Thus the proximate cause of failure is agent-side formatting, which the rubric explicitly excludes from benchmark deficiencies. | evidence: Harness error: ""Error in code parsing: Your code snippet is invalid, because the regex pattern ```python(.*?)``` was not found in it. Here is your code snippet: The requested function has been fully implemented.```"" and later similarly: ""Here is your code snippet: The implementation of `eos_eps_from_press` is complete and syntactically correct.```"". Also prompt inconsistency: ""Use the functions `eps_from_press` and `rho_from_press`"" vs provided `eos_eps_from_press`/`eos_rho_from_press`.

63,scicode,1.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The benchmark/evaluation harness appears to post-process the assistant’s code into a single function and strip imports (per system instruction), but later-step functions (e.g., construct_matrix, forward_iteration) require external modules (np, sparse) and/or previously-defined helper functions. This creates a structural mismatch: either (a) the harness does not preserve earlier definitions/imports across steps, or (b) the system-level “return ONLY one python function; remove imports/dependencies” instruction makes it impossible to include required imports for functions that must reference np/sparse. Either way, a correct agent implementation can still fail because the environment may execute the returned single function in isolation without the needed names bound. | causation_reasoning: The run ends marked failed even though the agent repeatedly produced plausible correct implementations for each step. The system then enforced a post-processing rule to output only one function with imports removed, which would make later functions referencing np/sparse or other helpers raise NameError in an isolated execution context. The trace shows the assistant complying with the “single function, no imports” requirement (e.g., final forward_iteration/price_option/price_option_of_time versions omit imports), indicating the harness likely executed a stripped function without necessary globals, causing failure independent of the agent’s logic. | evidence: System instruction: ""You are a tool that receives a block of text and python code and returns only a python function... Please remove any dependencies or imports... Your response should ONLY consist of one python function."" After this, the assistant outputs functions that rely on names not defined inside the function, e.g. final construct_matrix uses ""np"" and ""sparse"" but the tool-required version would remove imports; similarly final price_option_of_time calls ""price_option"" and ""initialize_grid"" which may not exist if run in isolation.

80,scicode,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The benchmark tasks and function headers are coherent and solvable in the stated environment. Required dependencies (numpy, scipy, scipy.constants) are available. The steps (dist, E_ij, E_pot, f_ij, forces, velocity_verlet, MD_NVT) are standard and implementable without contradictions. Although there is some mild ambiguity (e.g., mention of optional Yukawa without parameters; mass/units consistency), these do not make the task impossible for any agent; reasonable assumptions or using existing helper conventions suffice. | causation_reasoning: The run failed due to agent-side output/formatting and protocol violations, not because of an intrinsic benchmark deficiency. The agent produced non-code outputs that broke the harness’s expected ```python ... ``` extraction (e.g., outputting '0.83' and '0.83```'), triggering a parsing error. Additionally, the agent repeatedly included imports despite instructions to omit dependencies at the beginning, and later drifted across tasks. These are agent capability/compliance issues; the underlying tasks were executed successfully multiple times when the agent followed formatting. | evidence: Parsing failure is explicit: ""Error in code parsing: Your code snippet is invalid, because the regex pattern ```python(.*?)``` was not found in it. Here is your code snippet: 0.83```"". Agent output causing it: ""<|T0B30; role: assistant|> 0.83"" and ""<|T0B31; role: assistant|> 0.83```"".

71,scicode,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The benchmark materials contain intrinsic inconsistencies/mis-scaffolding: (1) earlier provided function code for `tensor(*args)` explicitly comments out the numpy import but then uses `np` anyway, making the supplied baseline code invalid in isolation (""# import numpy as np  # dependency removed"" followed by ""arr = np.asarray(...)""). (2) Multiple steps show mismatches between notes and headers (e.g., note claims header has no parameters while provided header actually uses `*args`). These are formation deficiencies in the benchmark/scaffold because the included code and notes are contradictory and can mislead agents about required signatures and available globals. | causation_reasoning: The run is marked failed due to an agent-side output formatting/parsing error, not due to the scaffold inconsistency. The agent at one point responded with plain prose instead of a ```python ...``` code block, triggering the parser error. After that, the agent did provide correctly formatted code blocks for the relevant functions (including `GADC_rev_coh_inf`). Thus, while deficiencies exist, they were not the proximate cause of the final failure in this trace. | evidence: Benchmark scaffold bug: ""# import numpy as np  # dependency removed"" immediately followed by ""arr = np.asarray(a, dtype=float)  # np undefined if numpy not imported"".
Failure cause is formatting: ""Error in code parsing: Your code snippet is invalid, because the regex pattern ```python(.*?)``` was not found in it.

12,scicode,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The benchmark's instructions are internally inconsistent: it says ""Use only the following dependencies... Do not include these dependencies at the beginning of your code"" while also requiring a ""complete and executable Python program"" and providing starter code that assumes `np`, `integrate`, and `optimize` are already imported. In a normal Python context, omitting imports would make the submission non-executable, but the harness appears to pre-import these modules. This mismatch can confuse agents about whether imports are allowed/necessary. Additionally, a later system post-processor requires output to be only one function with no imports, further conflicting with earlier instructions to provide a full program. | causation_reasoning: Despite the inconsistency, the agent successfully provided correctly formatted code blocks for the requested functions multiple times; the run failed because the agent output plain-text commentary (not wrapped in a ```python``` code block), which the harness explicitly rejects. This is an agent formatting error (a critical exclusion), not a benchmark formation deficiency preventing any agent from succeeding. The agent could have succeeded by simply returning the last requested function in a proper ```python``` block and not adding prose. | evidence: Failure trigger: ""Error in code parsing: Your code snippet is invalid, because the regex pattern ```python(.*?)``` was not found in it.
