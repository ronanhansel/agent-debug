2,scicode,1.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The benchmark creates a contradiction between (a) the dependency instructions and (b) the final harness that strips imports and expects a standalone function. The system instruction at the end says: ""remove any dependencies or imports"" and return ""ONLY consist of one python function"". But the produced function uses `np` extensively and, once imports are stripped, `np` is undefined unless the harness injects it into the function's global scope. The benchmark does not guarantee that `np` will exist after import stripping. This is a structural scaffolding issue: a correct solution can be rendered non-executable by the benchmark’s own post-processing. | causation_reasoning: The run is marked failed even though the agent produced a correct implementation and passed a unit test earlier when imports were present. The final system step removed the `import numpy as np` line while leaving `np` references inside the function. If the evaluator executes this stripped function without providing `np` in globals, it will fail with NameError regardless of agent quality. Thus the intrinsic misalignment (import stripping without guaranteed dependency injection) is the proximate cause of failure at evaluation time. | evidence: 1) System instruction: ""Do NOT add or change any functionality... remove any dependencies or imports... Your response should ONLY consist of one python function."" (T0B17)
2) The final returned function contains many `np.` references but no import: `k = 2.0 * np.pi / lambda_`, `np.linspace`, `np.meshgrid`, `np.fft...` (T0B19)
3) Earlier unit test passed only when `import numpy as np` existed in the environment: ""Unit test passed"" (T0B16), indicating functionality was fine prior to import stripping.
4) Agent run metadata indicates failure: `""failed"": true` despite a seemingly correct final function, consistent with a harness execution error due to missing `np`.",scicode_honey_openai_o4-mini_2025-04-16_low
28,scicode,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The benchmark task is well-formed and solvable in the stated environment. It provides clear function headers, required behavior (ABCD propagation + focus finding + intensity via Fourier propagation), and permitted dependencies (numpy, simpson). No contradictions or missing required information are present that would prevent any agent from completing it. The agent in fact produced working implementations earlier in the trace (including passing a free-space analytic check), indicating no intrinsic formation deficiency blocks success. | causation_reasoning: Failure was caused by agent output/formatting and compliance errors, not by the benchmark. The agent repeatedly responded with text like ""final_answer The function..."" without the required ```python ...``` wrapper and without calling final_answer correctly, triggering the harness parsing error. Near the end, despite being asked for the next-step function (Gussian_Lens_transmission), the agent output only propagate_gaussian_beam with a commented-out import, omitting required functions and thus failing the task. These are agent-side mistakes; the benchmark clearly instructed the required code-block format and function scope expectations. | evidence: Harness parsing error: ""Error in code parsing: Your code snippet is invalid, because the regex pattern ```python(.*?)``` was not found in it... It seems like you're trying to return the final answer, you can do it as follows: ```python\nfinal_answer(\""YOUR FINAL ANSWER HERE\"")\n```"". Agent repeated: ""final_answer The function and unit test both executed successfully..."". Later, when asked for Gussian_Lens_transmission, agent output only: ""```python\n# import numpy as np\ndef propagate_gaussian_beam(...): ...\n```"" (missing requested function). Earlier success demonstrates solvability: ""Unit test passed."" and later ""Numeric w(z)... Analytic w(z)... Absolute difference..."" showing correct implementation in-environment.",scicode_honey_openai_o4-mini_2025-04-16_low
52,scicode,1.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The benchmark requires the final submission to be only a single function without imports (per the system/tool instruction: “remove any dependencies or imports”), but the provided function templates and intended implementations depend on external modules (np, integrate, optimize) that are not passed as arguments nor guaranteed to exist as globals. This creates an intrinsic mismatch between what the evaluation harness extracts (a standalone function) and what is needed to run it. In particular, FindBoundStates uses optimize.root_scalar but the final extracted function cannot import optimize, and optimize is not otherwise defined inside the function. | causation_reasoning: The agent’s final code for FindBoundStates references optimize and Shoot, expecting optimize to be available. Under the enforced “single function, no imports” extraction, optimize will be undefined at runtime, causing NameError and task failure regardless of agent reasoning. This is not an agent logic bug; it is a scaffold/evaluation constraint that strips required imports while the task still requires SciPy calls. | evidence: System instruction at extraction stage: “Please remove any dependencies or imports from the code… Your response should ONLY consist of one python function.”
Final extracted function references optimize without importing it: “sol = optimize.root_scalar(…)”.
Dependencies are required by spec: “from scipy import integrate, optimize”, but the extraction step forbids including them inside the output function.
The agent’s final FindBoundStates output contains no imports: “def FindBoundStates(...): … sol = optimize.root_scalar …”.",scicode_honey_openai_o4-mini_2025-04-16_low
58,scicode,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: There are intrinsic inconsistencies in the benchmark materials. (1) The stated step says “compute specific internal energy given density”, but the provided function header to implement is `eos_eps_from_press(press, ...)`, i.e., from pressure, not density. (2) The TOV step text says to use `eps_from_press` and `rho_from_press`, but the provided helper functions are named `eos_eps_from_press` and `eos_rho_from_press`. These are formation/template mismatches that could mislead an agent and cause NameError or implementing the wrong function. | causation_reasoning: Despite the deficiencies, the agent implemented the expected functions correctly (including `eos_eps_from_press`, `tov_RHS`, and `tov`) and validated them with interpreter runs and unit tests. The only observed failure was an agent-side tool misuse: calling `python_interpreter` inside another `python_interpreter` snippet and/or attempting to call a function not defined in that snippet’s namespace, which the environment explicitly forbids. The agent later corrected this by defining the function within the same snippet. Therefore the benchmark deficiencies did not block completion; the proximate error was the agent’s execution/tool-usage mistake, not an unsatisfiable task setup. | evidence: Benchmark inconsistencies: “compute specific internal energy given density” vs header “def eos_eps_from_press(press, eos_Gamma, eos_kappa)”; and “Use the functions `eps_from_press` and `rho_from_press`” while provided names are `eos_eps_from_press`/`eos_rho_from_press`.
Agent failure was tool misuse: error states “Forbidden function evaluation: 'eos_eps_from_press' is not among the explicitly allowed tools or defined/imported in the preceding code” after the agent ran a unit test in a separate interpreter call without redefining the function, and also nested a `python_interpreter(...)` call inside the code string (“python_interpreter(code=\""\""\"" ... \""\""\"")”).
Agent ultimately succeeded in running tests: “Stdout:\n2.82842712474619 True” and later “Center test passed. Simple consistency test passed.” and “Realistic test (mass, lapse): (np.float64(1.3263360794074504), np.float64(0.7210263375067335))” indicating the task was solvable despite template issues.",scicode_honey_openai_o4-mini_2025-04-16_low
63,scicode,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: There are intrinsic issues in the benchmark materials/harness: (1) the prompt itself flags an error in the docstring about matrix D’s shape (docstring says (N_t-2)x(N_t-2) but correct is (N_p-2)x(N_p-2)), indicating mis-specified scaffolding. (2) The run shows the system/harness shifting instructions mid-run: at one point it enforces a tool-like constraint (“return only a python function… remove any dependencies or imports…”) which conflicts with the earlier task’s instruction to provide a full program with allowed imports, and later it enforces a regex-based requirement for ```python fences. These are benchmark/evaluation apparatus inconsistencies, not domain difficulties. | causation_reasoning: Despite the above deficiencies, the agent successfully implemented the required functions and produced correct code blocks multiple times. The recorded failure is due to agent-side output formatting: it responded with plain text (“The unit test passed successfully.”) and later attempted to wrap the final answer via `final_answer(...)` without providing a ```python code block, triggering the harness error. Since providing the correct fenced code block would have succeeded (and the agent did provide valid fenced code earlier), the deficiency did not block completion; the proximate cause was the agent’s formatting/tool-usage mistake. | evidence: Prompt admits spec error: “IMPORTANT: NOTE: The matrix D shape in the docstring is incorrectly stated as (N_t-2) x (N_t-2). The correct shape is (N_p-2) x (N_p-2)”.
Harness/format enforcement error: “Error in code parsing: Your code snippet is invalid, because the regex pattern ```python(.*?)``` was not found in it. Here is your code snippet: The unit test passed successfully.”
Agent formatting/tool misuse: it outputs only text “The unit test passed successfully.” and later: “final_answer(\n""""""def forward_iteration(... )""""""\n)” which again lacks a ```python fenced blob, causing the same parsing error.
Agent had already provided correct implementations in fenced code blocks (e.g., forward_iteration in ```python at T0B54 and price_option_of_time in ```python at T0B101), showing the task was solvable within the apparatus.",scicode_honey_openai_o4-mini_2025-04-16_low
71,scicode,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: There are formation issues in the benchmark materials: (1) multiple steps explicitly note mismatches between headers and how tests call functions (e.g., ket header note, tensor note). (2) The environment forbids some imports that an agent might reasonably use for unit tests (e.g., numpy.testing), which is not clearly flagged in the task statement itself (only in tool error). These are intrinsic benchmark/environment mismatches that could mislead agents. | causation_reasoning: Despite those deficiencies, the agent successfully implemented the required functions and validated them with allowed tools/imports. The only explicit failure shown in the trace is an agent-side unit test attempt using a disallowed import (numpy.testing), which was corrected on retry. The final implementations for later steps (tensor, syspermute, partial_trace, entropy, GADC channel, neg_rev_coh_info, GADC_rev_coh_inf) all executed successfully in the interpreter tests. Therefore, the benchmark deficiency did not cause the run to fail; the run’s marked failure appears unrelated to any unavoidable benchmark block. | evidence: Formation issues noted in prompt: ""NOTE: Function header only has 'dim' parameter but test cases call ket(2, 0)..."" and ""NOTE: Function header has no parameters but test cases call tensor([0,1],[0,1])..."". Environment/import mismatch encountered: ""Error: ... from numpy.testing import assert_array_equal ... InterpreterError: Import from numpy.testing is not allowed."" Agent later avoids it and passes: ""All unit tests passed."" Later functions also pass interpreter checks, e.g. ""Unit test passed: tensor(H, H)..."", ""Test 1 (identity): True"", ""GADC_rev_coh_inf(0,0) = 0.693...""",scicode_honey_openai_o4-mini_2025-04-16_low
80,scicode,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: There is an intrinsic inconsistency in the benchmark/scaffold about dependency availability and namespaces. The prompt says ""Do not include these dependencies at the beginning of your code"" while also listing allowed imports (including ""import scipy as sp""), but earlier system/tool constraints and later stage expectations sometimes require either using `sp` without importing it, or importing constants in-function. This is evidenced by the execution environment treating each `python_interpreter` call as isolated (no persistent state), which can contradict the agent’s plan steps that assume previously defined functions persist unless redefined in the same snippet. Additionally, at later steps the provided `f_ij` definition in the task text uses `np` but does not show an import, implying globals/imports may be preloaded, which is not consistently true in the interpreter tool snippets. | causation_reasoning: The agent’s run ultimately failed because the submitted final `MD_NVT` function used `sp.constants.k` without defining/importing `sp` within the function or relying on a guaranteed global import, leading to a runtime NameError in the unit test: the agent initially fixed this by switching to `from scipy.constants import k as k_B, Avogadro` inside the function, but the final answer reverted to using `sp.constants.k`. This is an agent-side implementation mistake rather than an unavoidable benchmark deficiency: a correct solution can simply import `k` from `scipy.constants` or use `scipy.constants` consistently. The interpreter error about `sp` was recoverable and the agent demonstrated a working corrected version, so the benchmark did not block success. | evidence: Runtime failure: ""InterpreterError: The variable `sp` is not defined."" at the MD_NVT unit test call.
Agent acknowledged and fixed: ""The error arose because `sp` was never imported... I will remove references to `sp` and instead import ... from `scipy.constants` inside the function.""
But final submitted function still contains: ""k_B = sp.constants.k"" and no `import scipy as sp` in-function or guaranteed global.
Non-persistent interpreter context noted by earlier error: ""Forbidden function evaluation: 'E_ij' is not among the explicitly allowed tools or defined/imported in the preceding code"" showing state does not persist across tool calls.",scicode_honey_openai_o4-mini_2025-04-16_low
