12,scicode,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The task prompt and scaffolding are internally consistent and solvable: code must be returned inside a ```python ...``` fenced block. The environment provides clear feedback when formatting is wrong, and earlier in the trace the agent successfully produced valid fenced code blocks that were accepted and executed (e.g., for f_Schrod_Hartree, extrapolate_polyfit, etc.). No contradictions or missing dependencies are evident that would block any agent. | causation_reasoning: The run failed due to the agent repeatedly outputting plain-text confirmations instead of a required python code block, triggering the evaluator’s parsing error. This is explicitly an agent output formatting error (excluded by rubric) and is recoverable (the agent later corrected by sending a proper fenced code block). Therefore the failure is not caused by any intrinsic benchmark deficiency. | evidence: Evaluator error: ""Error in code parsing: Your code snippet is invalid, because the regex pattern ```python(.*?)``` was not found in it."" after agent output: ""The unit-test passes..."" and later ""We successfully executed the code; the function is defined."" Similar formatting mistake: ""The function `scf_routine` has been fully implemented..."" followed by the same parser error. The task instructions clearly require fenced code: ""Ensure your response is in the format of ```python```."" Also shows recoverability: the agent later responds with a proper fenced code block: ""```python\ndef f_Schrod_Hartree(...): ...\n```"" which is accepted/executed.",scicode_sea_openai_o3-mini_2025
2,scicode,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The benchmark's dependency restrictions are internally inconsistent with what a reasonable solution requires. The provided allowed-dependency snippet only imports NumPy and `scipy.integrate.simpson as simps`, but the physics-based approach described (Hankel transform with J0) needs a Bessel J0 implementation (typically `scipy.special.j0`). The prompt never lists `scipy.special` among the allowed dependencies in the DEPENDENCIES section, yet the environment/tooling later permits `scipy.special` imports. This mismatch is a formation/spec issue (dependency list incomplete/contradictory). | causation_reasoning: Despite the above mismatch, the agent's run did not fail due to missing dependencies or runtime errors. The code executed in the tool environment (function object returned), and the only explicit failure shown was a response-format/parsing error when the agent replied without a ```python ...``` block. The framework error explicitly indicates the regex for code fencing was not found. Therefore the proximate cause of failure is an agent output formatting mistake, not the benchmark deficiency. | evidence: Parsing failure: ""Error in code parsing: Your code snippet is invalid, because the regex pattern ```python(.*?)``` was not found in it. Here is your code snippet: The function has been fully implemented in the earlier step..."".
Dependency mismatch evidence: DEPENDENCIES list ends with ""import numpy as np\nfrom scipy.integrate import simpson as simps"" and does not mention `scipy.special`, while the agent implementation uses ""from scipy.special import j0"".",scicode_sea_openai_o3-mini_2025
28,scicode,1.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The benchmark’s task context becomes internally inconsistent and misaligned with the evaluation harness. The original task asks for implementing `propagate_gaussian_beam`, then mid-trace the task changes to `gaussian_beam_through_lens`, then the agent is later told (without a corresponding task spec update) to implement a different function `Gussian_Lens_transmission(...)` returning three outputs. This indicates the benchmark materials/harness are not stable: the required function header and expected output contract shift across the run. Additionally, a system instruction later requires removing imports and returning ONLY one python function, but the assistant had been instructed earlier to include a “complete and executable Python program” and also “Do not include these dependencies at the beginning of your code” while the system ultimately strips imports—creating a structural mismatch between what is requested and what the harness expects. | causation_reasoning: The agent’s final code is for `Gussian_Lens_transmission` (with imports at top), while the user task immediately before failure still requests `gaussian_beam_through_lens`. Any competent agent would be unable to satisfy a moving target where the expected entrypoint alternates. The run is marked failed even though multiple functions were syntactically correct when executed in the interpreter; the most plausible proximate cause is that the grader expected a different function signature/name than what the agent ultimately provided due to the benchmark’s inconsistent task formation. Thus the intrinsic misalignment caused the failure rather than an implementation bug. | evidence: 1) Original required header: `def propagate_gaussian_beam(N, Ld, w0, z, L):` (early task).
2) Task later changes: `def gaussian_beam_through_lens(wavelength, w0, R0, Mf1, z, Mp2, L1, s):` (""New task"" section).
3) Agent is then prompted to implement a third function not in the immediately preceding task: `def Gussian_Lens_transmission(N, Ld, z, L, w0, R0, Mf1, Mp2, L1, s):` with outputs `Wz, focus_depth, Intensity` (agent's later ""Facts survey"" and subsequent code).
4) Contradictory harness instruction: system says ""returns only a python function... remove any dependencies or imports"" after earlier instructions ""Write the complete and executable Python program"" and ""Do not include these dependencies at the beginning of your code"".
5) Despite successful interpreter definitions (e.g., ""Last output from code snippet: <function create_function.<locals>.new_func ...>""), the run metadata ends with `""failed"": true` indicating evaluation mismatch rather than runtime syntax failure.",scicode_sea_openai_o3-mini_2025
35,scicode,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The benchmark contains an intrinsic underspecification: the quadratic-combination step is explicitly noted as truncated (""NOTE"": ""The original description is truncated - 'i,j,k are at least' is incomplete""), which leaves ambiguity about whether coefficients start at 0 or 1. However, the benchmark itself supplies an interpretation (""Based on the physics context ... coefficients should be positive integers starting from 1.""), which makes the task still solvable in practice. Additionally, later in the trace the task appears to drift (absorption() introduced) beyond the stated 'next step' function, suggesting some evaluation-context confusion, but the core missing info is the truncated coefficient constraint. | causation_reasoning: The agent's failure was not caused by the benchmark deficiency. The only explicit failure shown is a formatting/parsing error when the agent output ""0.55```"" without the required ```python fenced block, which the framework flagged. This is an agent output formatting error per the rubric's critical exclusion. The truncated description did not prevent implementing generate_quadratic_combinations; the agent did implement it multiple times. Therefore, the proximate cause of failure is agent-side formatting/noncompliance, not an intrinsic benchmark formation issue. | evidence: Underspecification: ""NOTE"": ""The original description is truncated - 'i,j,k are at least' is incomplete."" 
Failure mechanism: framework error: ""Error in code parsing: Your code snippet is invalid, because the regex pattern ```python(.*?)``` was not found in it. Here is your code snippet: 0.55```""

52,scicode,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The benchmark tasks are well-formed and solvable: each step provides a clear function signature and required behavior (ODE derivative, ODE integration + normalization, shooting extrapolation, and bracketing/root-finding). The allowed dependencies (numpy, scipy.integrate, scipy.optimize) are sufficient for the requested implementations, and the instructions to use integrate.simpson are compatible with the environment. No contradictions or missing critical information are evident that would prevent any capable agent from succeeding. | causation_reasoning: The recorded failure is attributable to agent-side output/formatting mistakes rather than an intrinsic benchmark deficiency. Specifically, the agent emitted stray text (e.g., '0.71') outside a required ```python``` code block, triggering the evaluator's parsing error. When the agent followed the required code-block format, the code parsed and the python_interpreter accepted the function definitions. Thus, the failure was not caused by the task formation but by the agent violating the response format constraints. | evidence: Parsing failure explicitly reported: ""Error in code parsing: Your code snippet is invalid, because the regex pattern ```python(.*?)``` was not found in it. Here is your code snippet: 0.71```"". Later, correctly formatted code blocks were accepted by the tool (e.g., ""Last output from code snippet: <function create_function.<locals>.new_func ...>""). The agent also produced stray output again: ""0.71```"" (T0B16).",scicode_sea_openai_o3-mini_2025
58,scicode,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The underlying tasks shown (implementing polytropic EOS functions and later TOV-related helpers) are well-specified and solvable in the stated environment. The benchmark provides clear function headers, expected I/O, and allowed dependencies. There is a docstring inconsistency (mentions 'eps' while the IMPORTANT note clarifies the function returns rho), but this is explicitly corrected by the prompt and does not block any agent. No evidence of missing files, impossible constraints, deprecated APIs being required, or evaluation/template misalignment that would prevent a correct solution from being recognized. | causation_reasoning: The run is marked failed due to an agent output formatting error, not due to a benchmark formation deficiency. The system explicitly required a code block matching the regex pattern ```python(.*?)```, and the agent responded with plain text instead of a python code block at one point, triggering the parser error. After the framework complained, the agent was able to provide a correct code block, showing the format was achievable and the failure was recoverable and agent-side. | evidence: Failure message: ""Error in code parsing: Your code snippet is invalid, because the regex pattern ```python(.*?)``` was not found in it. Here is your code snippet: The `tov_RHS` function has been fully implemented..."" The framework also instructed the correct format: ""Make sure to include code with the correct pattern... ```python # Your python code here ```"" The agent later retried with a proper code block: ""```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef tov_RHS(...): ...\n```"" indicating no intrinsic benchmark blockage.",scicode_sea_openai_o3-mini_2025
63,scicode,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The benchmark tasks shown are well-formed and solvable in the stated environment: function headers are provided, required behavior is standard (grid init, Black–Scholes boundary conditions, tri-diagonal matrix, time-marching), and allowed dependencies (numpy/scipy.sparse) are sufficient. The evaluation harness clearly specifies the required output formatting (a ```python ...``` code fence) and provides actionable feedback when formatting is wrong. While there are minor inconsistencies in the agent’s own summaries (e.g., misstatements about direction of time stepping) and some prompts omit the exact name of a previously-defined helper (grid initializer), none of these create an impossible or contradictory requirement for a competent agent; solutions can be implemented directly within each requested function or by reusing prior ones. Therefore no intrinsic formation deficiency is evidenced. | causation_reasoning: The recorded failure is driven by the agent’s output-formatting mistakes (returning plain text instead of a ```python``` fenced code block) and general run-control issues, not by any benchmark structural flaw. The harness explicitly reports the parsing error and how to fix it, and the agent subsequently succeeds multiple times by supplying correctly fenced code, demonstrating the task is executable and the evaluation is not blocking all attempts. Hence, even if minor ambiguities exist, they did not cause the failure; the proximate cause is agent-side formatting/noncompliance. | evidence: Formatting failure explicitly flagged by harness: ""Error in code parsing: Your code snippet is invalid, because the regex pattern ```python(.*?)``` was not found in it."" after the agent responded with plain text: ""The function has been implemented.````. The agent later provides properly formatted code blocks that run: e.g., apply_boundary_conditions and forward_iteration sections show successful python_interpreter runs with ""Last output... <function create_function...>"" and subsequent correctly fenced code. This indicates the benchmark was solvable and failures were recoverable by correct formatting.",scicode_sea_openai_o3-mini_2025
71,scicode,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: There are minor formation issues in the benchmark text: (1) several steps note that the provided function header mismatches how tests call it (e.g., ket note; tensor note). This is a documentation/scaffolding inconsistency, though in practice the headers shown already include the needed parameters/varargs. (2) Later tasks reference helper functions with inconsistent names: the agent implemented `neg_rev_coh_info`, but the subsequent task says a helper `neg_coh_info` exists and should be used by `GADC_rev_coh_inf`, creating potential ambiguity if the environment doesn't provide an alias. These are intrinsic spec/template inconsistencies, but not necessarily blocking because a capable agent can still implement the requested function(s) given the actual headers and can adapt to naming. | causation_reasoning: The observed failure is driven by agent-side output formatting violations, explicitly flagged by the harness. The agent repeatedly responded with plain English instead of a required ```python``` code block (e.g., after implementing tensor, syspermute, generalized_amplitude_damping_channel), triggering parse errors. When the agent did provide properly fenced code blocks, the harness accepted and executed them (showing the created function object). Thus, even if minor spec inconsistencies exist, they did not prevent success; the proximate cause of failure was the agent's formatting/output mistakes. | evidence: Parse failures explicitly cite formatting: ""Error in code parsing: Your code snippet is invalid, because the regex pattern ```python(.*?)``` was not found in it."" followed by the agent's non-code response: ""The `tensor` function has been implemented..."" (T0B35). Similar formatting failure after syspermute: ""The `syspermute` function has been fully implemented."" (T0B76). Another formatting failure after generalized_amplitude_damping_channel: agent wrote prose and got the same regex error (T0B142). When code was correctly provided, the interpreter produced function objects without errors, e.g., tensor implementation accepted (T0B29-T0B33), syspermute accepted (T0B70-T0B74), and GADC_rev_coh_inf accepted (T0B168-T0B172). Spec inconsistency evidence: task note: ""Function header has no parameters but test cases call tensor([0,1],[0,1])..."" and earlier: ""NOTE: Function header only has 'dim' parameter but test cases call ket(2, 0)...""; naming mismatch: ""A helper routine called `neg_coh_info` exists"" while agent implemented `neg_rev_coh_info`.",scicode_sea_openai_o3-mini_2025
80,scicode,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The tasks are well-formed and solvable: each step provides a clear function header (e.g., dist, E_ij, E_pot, f_ij, forces, velocity_verlet, MD_NVT) and standard physics/math definitions. The evaluation harness requirement (a ```python ... ``` fenced code block) is explicit in the prompt and reinforced by the parser error messages. There is no contradiction in dependencies or templates that would prevent a correct solution from being submitted; in fact, the agent repeatedly produced correct fenced code blocks that parsed and executed in the tool. | causation_reasoning: The run failed due to agent-side formatting/output behavior: after successfully providing correct code blocks, the agent often followed with non-code explanatory text, which the harness attempted to parse as code and rejected because it lacked the required ```python``` fence. This is explicitly excluded by the rubric as an agent capability/formatting error, not a benchmark formation deficiency. When the agent responded with a fenced code block, the system accepted it (tool execution succeeded), demonstrating that the benchmark was not blocking completion. | evidence: Multiple parser errors show formatting as the failure mechanism: ""Error in code parsing: Your code snippet is invalid, because the regex pattern ```python(.*?)``` was not found in it."" Examples include when the agent responded with plain text: ""The `dist` function has been fully implemented..."" and later ""Apologies, I do not have more actions."" and ""I have implemented the `E_ij` function according to the plan."" and ""The `forces` function has been implemented..."" and ""Implemented the `velocity_verlet` function..."". Conversely, when the agent included a proper code fence, the tool accepted/ran it: e.g., after providing code, the python tool output was ""<function create_function.<locals>.new_func at ...>"" (seen repeatedly at T0B7, T0B14, T0B20, T0B43, T0B55, T0B72, T0B92, T0B112, T0B132, T0B141), indicating solvability and correct parsing when formatted properly.",scicode_sea_openai_o3-mini_2025
