12,scicode,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The benchmark task (implementing f_Schrod, Numerov, and later compute_Schrod with Simpson normalization and specified step/ICs) is well-formed and solvable with the provided dependencies. The function signatures are clear, required constants/formulas are standard, and no required libraries are missing. While the agent encountered multiple tool parsing errors, these were due to how the agent embedded tool calls and triple-quoted strings inside code passed to python_interpreter, not due to contradictions or unsatisfied assumptions in the benchmark itself. | causation_reasoning: The run failed due to agent-side formatting/tool-usage errors (unterminated strings/triple quotes, invalid code passed to python_interpreter, mixing tool calls inside the code string). Where the agent eventually produced clean code blocks (e.g., compute_Schrod), they executed successfully. Thus, there is no intrinsic benchmark deficiency causing failure; the proximate causes were the agent’s repeated syntax/quoting mistakes and incorrect tool-call embedding. | evidence: Repeated interpreter parse failures originate from agent-constructed strings:
- ""Code parsing failed on line 77 due to: SyntaxError: invalid decimal literal ... r_grid: the radial grid; a 1D array of float (SI units: meters)""
- ""SyntaxError: unexpected character after line continuation character ... \""\""\""Input""
- ""SyntaxError: unterminated triple-quoted string literal ... final_code = \""\""\""""
- ""SyntaxError: unterminated triple-quoted string literal ... final_answer(\""\""\""""
- ""SyntaxError: unterminated string literal ... code_text = \""""
Also, clean code later executed fine:

2,scicode,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The task description is scientifically and computationally underspecified: it asks to “simulate the diffraction… and compute the resulting intensity distribution on a plane” but does not specify key modeling choices needed to define a unique output (e.g., propagation model: Fresnel/Fraunhofer/Angular Spectrum; observation plane distance or focal plane definition; aperture size/stop; sampling extents and pixel size; whether to include lens thickness phase and how; coordinate system and output array shape). It also provides mr2/ne2/mr0 but does not state how these map to the required 2D Ie[i][j] grid. Multiple valid implementations could differ materially yet still satisfy the text. | causation_reasoning: Despite underspecification, the agent did not fail because of it; the trace shows the agent never implemented the function and instead made empty tool calls. The immediate failure is due to the agent producing no code/solution, not because the benchmark prevented execution or forced an impossible requirement. | evidence: Agent produced no implementation: response contains empty blocks: ""Here are the facts I know and the plan of action that I will follow to solve the task:\n```\n\n```"" and later again: ""Here are the facts I know and my new/updated plan of action to solve the task:\n```\n\n```"". Tool calls were made with empty arguments: ""python_interpreter"", ""arguments"": """" (multiple times), yielding ""Last output from code snippet: None"". Task underspecification evidenced by missing required simulation parameters: prompt only gives ""mr2 is 51... ne2 is 61... mr0 is 81..."" and asks for intensity on ""a plane"" without plane distance/focal plane definition or output sampling details.",scicode_sea_openai_gpt-5-mini_2025
28,scicode,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The benchmark/task framing contains conflicting, stage-misaligned instructions that could confuse an agent: it repeatedly asks for a single python code block implementing a function, but the surrounding system/tooling later injects additional meta-instructions (e.g., to output only a plan, or to output only one python function with imports removed), and the conversation mixes multiple tasks (Gaussian propagation then lens ABCD waist) in one transcript. This is an intrinsic scaffolding/context issue (the evaluation harness appears to chain different prompts with different output requirements). However, despite this inconsistency, it is still possible for a capable agent to succeed by outputting the requested final function in the required format for the active task. | causation_reasoning: The agent’s recorded failure was not caused by the benchmark inconsistency; it failed due to its own tool/formatting mistakes while trying to embed code fences inside python tool calls, creating unterminated triple-quoted strings. Specifically, the agent attempted to construct a string containing a ```python block inside another triple-quoted string passed to python_interpreter, triggering SyntaxError. The underlying task itself was solvable (the agent even produced working implementations and a passing numerical sanity test earlier). Thus the proximate failure is an agent-side formatting/quoting error, which the rubric explicitly excludes as a benchmark deficiency cause. | evidence: Agent-side error: ""Error: Code parsing failed on line 108 due to: SyntaxError: unterminated triple-quoted string literal"" and later ""Code parsing failed on line 100 due to: SyntaxError: unterminated triple-quoted string literal"".
Working solution earlier: unit test passed: ""Unit test - beam broadening with z>0: PASS"".
Intrinsic misalignment example: multiple conflicting output-format regimes appear (e.g., system later: ""returns only a python function... remove any dependencies or imports"" vs earlier: ""Use only the following dependencies... Do not include these dependencies at the beginning of your code"" and repeated stage changes from ""facts survey/plan"" to ""implement function""; plus task shift from propagate_gaussian_beam to gaussian_beam_through_lens).",scicode_sea_openai_gpt-5-mini_2025
35,scicode,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The quadratic-combinations subtask is intrinsically underspecified: the prompt admits truncation (""i,j,k are at least""), and the agent/benchmark adds an extra assumption (""Based on the physics context... starting from 1""). Additionally, it is unclear whether outputs should include duplicates (different (i,j,k) yielding same value) or be unique (the agent used np.unique). Such ambiguity can affect expected outputs. However, these issues are about the problem statement, not the environment. | causation_reasoning: The run’s failure is not caused by this underspecification. The agent ultimately produced a correct-looking implementation for generate_quadratic_combinations, but the transcript shows repeated agent-side tool/formatting and coding errors (unterminated triple-quoted strings in test scaffolding; returning None due to missing return in a draft; mixing extra code strings), which triggered execution/parsing failures. The final evaluation marks the run failed even though the final function was output, indicating the failure stemmed from the agent’s execution/interaction mistakes and later task confusion (the system switched to a different 'absorption' step while the agent reverted to 'ground_state_wavelength'). | evidence: Underspecification evidence: ""**NOTE**: The original description is truncated - 'i,j,k are at least' is incomplete."" and ""Based on the physics context... coefficients should be positive integers starting from 1."" and use of deduplication: ""unique_vals = np.unique(...)"".
Agent-side failure evidence: ""SyntaxError: unterminated triple-quoted string literal"" at ""code_str = \""\""\"""" and later at ""final_code = \""\""\""""; runtime failure: ""TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()"" after ""Test 1 result: None"" (missing return in earlier draft).

52,scicode,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The benchmark tasks shown are well-formed and solvable within the stated environment: implement ODE derivative (Schroed_deriv), integrate from large r and normalize (SolveSchroedinger), extrapolate (Shoot), and bracket/root-find bound states (FindBoundStates). Dependencies requested (numpy, scipy.integrate, scipy.optimize) are available, and required APIs (integrate.solve_ivp, integrate.simpson, optimize.brentq) exist. There is no intrinsic contradiction or missing information that would prevent a competent agent from completing the step(s). Earlier tool errors (string quoting, forbidden imports) were caused by the agent's interaction with the tool, not by the benchmark specification. | causation_reasoning: The observed failures stem from agent-side issues: (1) tool-call misuse and quoting errors caused SyntaxError when embedding triple-quoted docstrings inside a triple-quoted string passed to python_interpreter; (2) attempting to import the tool wrapper inside python_interpreter ('from python_interpreter import python_interpreter'), which is disallowed by the tool sandbox. These are explicitly agent implementation/usage errors and are recoverable by correct formatting and not importing tool wrappers. The later stages show functions compiling successfully, indicating the task itself was not blocking. Thus no intrinsic benchmark deficiency caused the run failure. | evidence: Agent-side quoting failure: ""Code parsing failed on line 7 due to: SyntaxError: invalid syntax"" with caret at the docstring start inside code = r'''... def Schroed_deriv... '''Calculate..."".
Agent-side forbidden import: ""InterpreterError: Import from python_interpreter is not allowed"" triggered by ""from python_interpreter import python_interpreter"" inside the code passed to python_interpreter.

58,scicode,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The benchmark materials contain internal inconsistencies that could mislead an agent: (a) it instructs to use functions `eps_from_press` and `rho_from_press`, but earlier provided/defined functions are named `eos_eps_from_press` and `eos_rho_from_press`; no definitions for `eps_from_press`/`rho_from_press` are shown. (b) multiple places have contradictory task instructions (facts/plans vs code-only), and one earlier step includes a docstring explicitly wrong about returning `eps` while the task says return `rho`. These are formation/scaffolding issues because the provided names/specs don’t consistently match. | causation_reasoning: The agent’s recorded failure was not due to these benchmark inconsistencies; it was due to agent-side output formatting/tool misuse. Specifically, the agent returned code without the required ```python ... ``` fence and later tried to build fenced strings via unterminated triple-quoted literals, triggering syntax errors. The final correct `tov_RHS` implementation was accepted when wrapped properly. Thus, while inconsistencies exist, they were not the proximate cause of failure in this run. | evidence: 1) Function-name mismatch in prompt: ""Use the functions `eps_from_press` and `rho_from_press`"" vs earlier provided function header/code: ""def eos_eps_from_press(press, eos_Gamma, eos_kappa): ..."" and note about ""eos_rho_from_press"".
2) Formatting failure causing error: ""Your code snippet is invalid, because the regex pattern ```python(.*?)``` was not found in it."" (T0B60).
3) Agent tool misuse with syntax error: ""SyntaxError: unterminated triple-quoted string literal"" when creating `program = """"""` / `code_block = """"""` (T0B15, T0B22).
4) The `tov_RHS` code itself executed successfully in python_interpreter earlier (T0B52/T0B58), indicating solvability once formatting is correct.",scicode_sea_openai_gpt-5-mini_2025
63,scicode,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The benchmark tasks shown (initialize_grid, apply_boundary_conditions, construct_matrix, forward_iteration) are well-specified and solvable with the stated dependencies. The environment constraints were clear via error messages (e.g., exec/locals forbidden), and compliant solutions were possible (the agent successfully implemented initialize_grid and construct_matrix). No template/scaffolding mismatch or impossible requirement is evident. | causation_reasoning: The run failed due to agent-side errors in tool usage and testing/code construction, not due to an intrinsic benchmark deficiency. The agent repeatedly embedded unterminated triple-quoted strings when building large code snippets, attempted forbidden functions (exec, locals), and later produced a failing unit test for forward_iteration resulting in a matmul dimension error. These are implementation/test harness mistakes by the agent; the task itself remained solvable. | evidence: - Tooling constraint violations: ""InterpreterError: Forbidden function evaluation: 'exec'"" and ""Forbidden function evaluation: 'locals'"".
- Repeated agent formatting/quoting errors: ""SyntaxError: unterminated triple-quoted string literal"" at multiple points.
- Final failure is an agent test/logic error: ""ValueError: matmul: Input operand 0 does not have enough dimensions"" when running _run_tests() for forward_iteration.

71,scicode,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The benchmark task itself (implementing tensor(*args) and later syspermute) is well-specified and solvable in the given environment using NumPy reshape/transpose/kron. The notes about function headers vs. test calls are consistent (using *args), and there is no contradiction that would block any capable agent. The python_interpreter environment constraint (no cross-snippet state, restricted imports) is clearly enforced and does not make the task impossible. | causation_reasoning: The run is marked failed due to the agent’s tool/formatting misuse, not a benchmark deficiency. Specifically, the agent repeatedly caused SyntaxError by appending an unterminated triple-quoted string involving final_answer inside python_interpreter code (e.g., `final_answer(""""""` without closing). Earlier, the agent also hit a scope issue by trying to call syspermute in a separate python_interpreter snippet where it wasn’t defined; this is an agent error in using the tool (the environment requires definitions within the same snippet), not an intrinsic task flaw. The agent had already implemented correct functions (tensor and syspermute) and even validated them in prior snippets; the failure came from malformed wrapper/testing code and tool invocation patterns. | evidence: - Tool restriction encountered due to cross-snippet usage: ""Forbidden function evaluation: 'syspermute' is not among the explicitly allowed tools or defined/imported in the preceding code"" (when running a test snippet without redefining syspermute).
- Final failure due to agent-produced syntax error: ""SyntaxError: unterminated triple-quoted string literal ... final_answer(\""\""\"""" (at least twice: call_4 and call_6).
- The core tensor implementation was correct and passed tests: logs show ""Allclose to np.kron: True"" and correct shapes, and later the final tensor function definition was accepted by python_interpreter.
- syspermute logic itself was previously defined successfully (call_2: returned a function object) and the agent’s own earlier narrative claimed tests passed; failure arose when embedding final_answer strings in interpreter code.",scicode_sea_openai_gpt-5-mini_2025
80,scicode,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The core benchmark task (implement minimum-image distance `dist(r1,r2,L)` for a cubic periodic box) is well-specified and solvable with the allowed dependencies. The trace shows a correct implementation was produced and a unit test passed. Later, the conversation drifted into unrelated functions (`E_ij`, `E_pot`, `f_ij`) due to agent confusion and system/tooling prompts, but this does not indicate an intrinsic benchmark formation deficiency in the original `dist` task itself. | causation_reasoning: The run is marked failed, but not because the benchmark made the task impossible. The agent demonstrated capability to solve and test `dist` correctly (unit test passed). The only actual execution failure shown was an agent-introduced syntax error with unterminated triple quotes during an unrelated testing attempt for `E_pot` (not a benchmark-imposed constraint). Thus, any failure is attributable to agent behavior/formatting/derailment rather than an intrinsic benchmark deficiency. | evidence: Successful `dist` implementation and test: ""Unit test passed."" with output ""dist result: 0.19999999999999996"". Agent-introduced error unrelated to benchmark: ""SyntaxError: unterminated triple-quoted string literal"" (caused by the agent constructing a malformed triple-quoted string).
