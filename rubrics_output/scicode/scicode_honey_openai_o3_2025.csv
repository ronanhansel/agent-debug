12,scicode,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The task specification is internally consistent and solvable in the stated environment. The benchmark clearly requires responses in a ```python``` fenced code block and provides compatible dependencies (numpy/scipy with shims). No contradiction in required algorithms vs available libraries is evident. The repeated failures are tied to the agent emitting non-code narrative text that violates the explicit formatting contract, not to any missing information, outdated APIs, or template/evaluator mismatch that would block any correct agent. | causation_reasoning: The run failed due to agent-side output formatting mistakes: after providing correct code blocks, the agent intermittently output plain text (e.g., numeric values or prose summaries) which the harness could not parse as code, triggering regex errors. This is explicitly excluded from benchmark deficiencies by the rubric. When the agent returned to proper ```python``` blocks, parsing succeeded again, demonstrating the task/evaluation setup was workable and the failure was not intrinsically caused by the benchmark. | evidence: Multiple harness errors show the same issue: ""Error in code parsing: Your code snippet is invalid, because the regex pattern ```python(.*?)``` was not found in it."" Examples:
- After agent output: ""0.82```"" (and similarly ""0.9```""), harness error states the pattern was not found.
- After agent provided a prose summary: ""Implemented the `find_bound_states_Hartree` function..."", harness again: ""regex pattern ```python(.*?)``` was not found"".
Conversely, when the agent outputs code fences, the log shows successful parsing/execution, e.g., ""Observation: Execution logs: Last output from code snippet: <function create_function.<locals>.new_func ...>"" following properly fenced ```python code.",scicode_honey_openai_o3_2025
2,scicode,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The task specification is internally consistent and solvable: it provides a clear function signature, inputs/outputs, and allowed dependencies. The requirement to return a 2D intensity array with fixed discretization (mr2=51, ne2=61, mr0=81) is feasible. Dependency notes and shims are not contradictory, and the environment supports required SciPy/NumPy components. No template/harness mismatch is evident because earlier code blocks were accepted and created a function successfully. | causation_reasoning: The failure was caused by the agent outputting an invalid response format (a stray numeric string) rather than by any benchmark formation deficiency. The harness explicitly requires a ```python ...``` code block; the agent emitted `0.83````, triggering the regex parsing error. This is an agent formatting/output error and is explicitly excluded from being considered a benchmark deficiency. When the agent did provide proper code blocks, the system successfully parsed them (as indicated by creation of the function object). | evidence: Parsing failure: ""Error in code parsing: Your code snippet is invalid, because the regex pattern ```python(.*?)``` was not found in it. Here is your code snippet: 0.83```"". Prior successful parses: ""Last output from code snippet: <function create_function.<locals>.new_func ...>"" appears multiple times after valid ```python blocks. The agent produced stray output: ""0.83"" and ""0.83```"" immediately before the parsing error.",scicode_honey_openai_o3_2025
28,scicode,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The benchmark instructions, dependencies, and function headers are internally consistent and solvable in the given environment. The required functions can be implemented using NumPy (FFT and ABCD math) without missing libraries or contradictory constraints. The evaluation harness clearly specifies formatting requirements (a ```python``` code block) and later even provides explicit feedback when the agent violates it. No template/scaffolding mismatch or underspecification prevents a correct solution from being recognized. | causation_reasoning: The observed failure is due to agent-side output/formatting and instruction-following issues, not an intrinsic benchmark deficiency. The agent produced non-code text outputs (e.g., ""0.9"" / ""0.9```""), triggering the harness parsing error. When the agent did output a proper Python code block, the harness accepted it (showing a function object in logs), indicating the task was executable and evaluable. Therefore, failure was not caused by any benchmark formation problem. | evidence: Harness error explicitly attributes failure to missing code fence: ""Error in code parsing: Your code snippet is invalid, because the regex pattern ```python(.*?)``` was not found in it. Here is your code snippet: 0.9```"". Also, multiple times execution logs show code blocks were accepted/compiled: ""Last output from code snippet: <function create_function.<locals>.new_func at ...>"". The agent produced stray outputs unrelated to required code: ""<|T0B15; role: assistant|> 0.9"" and ""<|T0B16; role: assistant|> 0.9```"".",scicode_honey_openai_o3_2025
35,scicode,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: There are intrinsic issues in the benchmark specification: (1) It states ""Use only ... import numpy as np, import itertools"" but multiple parts of the run (and likely the harness that rewraps code) introduce/allow other stdlib modules (e.g., heapq, math) and later even enforce removal of imports, creating inconsistent expectations. (2) The function spec for generate_quadratic_combinations says output is a numpy array, but later a system sanitizer rewrites/accepts a Python list return (and the agent outputs lists in the final absorption), indicating the evaluation apparatus is not aligned with the stated contract. (3) The multi-step task description is repeatedly replaced/overlaid with new tasks, and the harness sometimes expects a code-fenced snippet even when the agent is only asked to comment, which is a confusing evaluation context.
Despite these, each individual subproblem is still solvable with the stated dependencies and format, so these are deficiencies but not necessarily blocking. | causation_reasoning: The recorded failure is not caused by an intrinsic benchmark deficiency but by agent-side formatting mistakes. The agent output plain text without a ```python``` block and triggered a parsing error; the harness explicitly explains the required format and a subsequent retry with a proper code fence proceeded. The final failure flag appears after these agent formatting/interaction errors rather than an unavoidable benchmark contradiction. Additionally, where dependency restrictions existed, the agent could comply (and later did, using only numpy/itertools). | evidence: Agent formatting error: ""Error in code parsing: Your code snippet is invalid, because the regex pattern ```python(.*?)``` was not found in it."" after the agent replied with plain text: ""The function was implemented successfully..."".
Dependency/contract mismatch examples: task says ""Output: C (size N numpy array)"" yet later sanitized output returns a list: ""Returns\n    -------\n    list"" and final absorption returns a Python list: ""return sorted(wavelengths_nm, reverse=True)"".

52,scicode,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The tasks are well-formed and solvable in the stated environment. Required dependencies (numpy, scipy.integrate, scipy.optimize) are available, and the function headers/specs are consistent with standard SciPy usage (e.g., solve_ivp, integrate.simpson, optimize.brentq). While there is a minor instruction tension (""Do not include these dependencies at the beginning of your code"" vs. later agent outputs including imports), it does not make the task impossible because imports can be omitted in the final response and the harness can provide them; other parts of the run show successful function definitions. No template/harness mismatch is evidenced that would prevent any correct solution from being recognized. | causation_reasoning: The run fails due to an agent formatting/output error, not due to any benchmark deficiency. Near the end, the agent outputs a numeric value with stray backticks (""0.86```"") instead of a required ```python fenced code block, triggering the parser error. The system explicitly instructs the expected format and the parser indicates the missing regex match for a python code block. This is recoverable and agent-caused, not an intrinsic problem. | evidence: Failure is explicitly a formatting parse error: ""Error in code parsing: Your code snippet is invalid, because the regex pattern ```python(.*?)``` was not found in it. Here is your code snippet: 0.86```"". The agent produced the offending output: ""<|T0B50|> 0.86"" and ""<|T0B51|> 0.86```"".

58,scicode,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: There is an intrinsic conflict between the task's dependency restrictions and the provided/required solution pattern. The prompt says: ""Use only the following dependencies... Do not include these dependencies at the beginning of your code"" while later steps (the agent's integration-based `tov` solution) practically require `numpy`/`scipy.integrate` to exist in scope. In many SciCode harnesses, imports are pre-provided; however the benchmark text itself is contradictory/underspecified about whether `np`/`si` will be injected. This is a formation deficiency because the instruction forbids imports but the function (especially `tov`) needs `np` and `si` unless the harness injects them, which is not clearly guaranteed by the task statement. | causation_reasoning: The agent's failure does not appear to be caused by this deficiency. The execution logs repeatedly show successful creation of functions (e.g., ""<function create_function.<locals>.new_func ...>"") with no ImportError/NameError. This indicates the harness likely extracted function bodies and/or provided imports, so the dependency conflict did not block execution. The run is marked failed, but the trace does not show a benchmark-imposed impossibility; rather, the agent exhibited process/output issues (e.g., irrelevant tool calls with empty arguments, repeated meta text, and a placeholder response ""# Implementation of tov completed above.""), suggesting an agent-side capability/compliance failure rather than an intrinsic benchmark block. | evidence: Dependency conflict in prompt: ""Use only the following dependencies... Do not include these dependencies at the beginning of your code.\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport scipy as sp\nimport scipy.integrate as si"". Yet the final required function uses np/si (e.g., agent's `tov` uses ""np"" and ""si.solve_ivp""). Despite that, logs show successful function creation: ""Last output from code snippet: <function create_function.<locals>.new_func ...>"" multiple times (e.g., after `tov_RHS`, `tov`, etc.), and no ImportError/NameError is shown. Agent-side issue example: response ""```python\n# Implementation of tov completed above.\n```"" and empty tool call: ""Calling tools: ... python_interpreter, arguments: ''"" followed by ""Last output ... None"".",scicode_honey_openai_o3_2025
63,scicode,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: There is a benchmark-side deficiency: the problem statement/docstring for `forward_iteration` incorrectly specifies the shape of matrix D as (N_t-2) x (N_t-2), while D should operate on the price dimension and thus be (N_p-2) x (N_p-2). This is explicitly acknowledged later in the task text (""IMPORTANT: NOTE: The matrix D shape in the docstring is incorrectly stated...""). This inconsistency could confuse agents and is an intrinsic formation/specification defect. | causation_reasoning: The agent's failure was not caused by this spec defect. The run fails due to output-formatting/parsing errors: the agent repeatedly responded with prose without a ```python ...``` code block, triggering the harness error ""regex pattern ```python(.*?)``` was not found"". When the agent did provide code blocks, they executed (logs show function objects), so the underlying tasks were solvable. Thus the proximate cause is the agent's formatting noncompliance, which the rubric explicitly excludes from benchmark deficiencies. | evidence: Intrinsic spec defect: ""**IMPORTANT**: NOTE: The matrix D shape in the docstring is incorrectly stated as (N_t-2) x (N_t-2). The correct shape is (N_p-2) x (N_p-2)..."".

71,scicode,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: There are intrinsic formation issues in the benchmark materials: multiple steps include contradictory notes about function headers vs how tests call them (e.g., earlier steps note header mismatch for ket/tensor). Additionally, the environment later injects a system instruction to output only a single function and remove imports, which conflicts with earlier response guidelines requiring a full code block. These are real benchmark/scaffolding inconsistencies that could confuse agents. | causation_reasoning: Despite those inconsistencies, the run's final failure is not caused by an unsatisfiable benchmark. The agent repeatedly produced non-code text (e.g., '0.71```', '0.77```', and narrative explanations) which triggered the parser error requiring a ```python``` block. The framework provided clear corrective feedback, and the agent successfully produced properly formatted code blocks in other turns, demonstrating the task was solvable. The final state shows a valid implementation of GADC_rev_coh_inf in a python code block; the failure stems from the agent's intermittent formatting/output behavior rather than an intrinsic barrier. | evidence: Formation issues: ""**NOTE**: Function header only has 'dim' parameter but test cases call ket(2, 0)..."" and similarly for tensor.
Agent-caused failures: ""Error in code parsing: Your code snippet is invalid, because the regex pattern ```python(.*?)``` was not found in it. Here is your code snippet: 0.77```"" and later ""Here is your code snippet: 0.71```"".
Agent also outputs narrative instead of code: ""The `GADC_rev_coh_inf` function has been implemented. It:"" followed by a parser error for missing ```python```.
Solvability evidenced by successful code blocks: the agent provides valid ```python``` blocks defining functions (e.g., syspermute, partial_trace, entropy, neg_rev_coh_info, GADC_rev_coh_inf) and the interpreter returns ""<function create_function.<locals>.new_func ...>"" without runtime errors.",scicode_honey_openai_o3_2025
80,scicode,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: There is an intrinsic ambiguity/inconsistency in the benchmark’s unit conventions across steps. Earlier steps describe/implement energies inconsistently: `E_pot`’s docstring says epsilon is in kJ/mol and returns zJ via Avogadro conversion, but later steps (force/forces/velocity_verlet/MD_NVT) treat epsilon as zJ and forces as zJ/nm, and MD_NVT assumes mass is g/mol while velocity_verlet divides force by `m` directly (implying `m` is per-particle mass in consistent units). This is a formation deficiency because the task materials do not specify a coherent, single unit system; multiple incompatible interpretations are plausible and could be graded differently. | causation_reasoning: Despite the unit inconsistency, the agent’s final failure in the run is not due to an unsolvable benchmark constraint but due to agent output/formatting behavior (and a disallowed import during testing). Specifically, the agent produced non-code text that failed the evaluator’s regex for ```python blocks (a known agent-side formatting error), and earlier attempted to import `numpy.testing`, which the environment explicitly disallowed. When the agent did provide proper code blocks, they executed successfully (returning function objects). Thus the proximate cause of failure was agent formatting/tool-use, not the benchmark’s intrinsic ambiguity. | evidence: Formatting failure: ""Error in code parsing: Your code snippet is invalid, because the regex pattern ```python(.*?)``` was not found in it. Here is your code snippet: The `f_ij` function implementing..."" and later similarly for velocity_verlet: ""regex pattern ... was not found"".
Disallowed import during agent testing: ""Code execution failed at line 'import numpy.testing as npt' due to: InterpreterError: Import of numpy.testing is not allowed.""
Unit inconsistency in benchmark text/code: E_pot docstring: ""epsilon : float ... in kJ mol⁻¹"" and conversion ""kJmol_to_zJ = 1000.0 / Avogadro * 1e21""; later forces docstring: ""epsilon ...
