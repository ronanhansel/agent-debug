12,scicode,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The benchmark tasks are solvable and the environment/tooling is consistent: required dependencies (numpy/scipy) are available, function headers are provided, and the harness clearly enforces response formatting. Although the trace shows some confusing mid-run “system” message about stripping imports and returning only one function, that is not intrinsic to the benchmark task itself; it is a separate instruction layer and does not make the underlying tasks impossible. The functions requested (e.g., f_Schrod_Hartree, compute_Schrod_Hartree, extrapolate_polyfit, calculate_charge_density_Hartree) can all be implemented within the constraints as demonstrated earlier in the trace. | causation_reasoning: The run failure stems from agent-side errors rather than a benchmark formation deficiency. The agent repeatedly violated the response-format requirement by returning prose via final_answer without a ```python``` block (triggering an explicit parser error), and later produced incorrect code by omitting required imports/namespace usage and calling undefined names (e.g., using polyfit/polyval without np.). Additionally, the agent left placeholder functions (e.g., new_func) unimplemented at points. These are implementation/formatting mistakes; the harness gave clear guidance on the correct format and the agent could have complied. | evidence: Format enforcement error: ""Error in code parsing: Your code snippet is invalid, because the regex pattern ```python(.*?)``` was not found in it."" after the agent output:
""final_answer(\n\""\""\"" ... \""\""\""\n)"".
Earlier missing-definition error shows agent-side omission: ""InterpreterError: Forbidden function evaluation: 'numerov' is not among the explicitly allowed tools or defined/imported in the preceding code"" when running a unit test calling compute_Schrod that referenced numerov not defined in that snippet.
Incorrect implementation later: agent rewrote extrapolate_polyfit using undefined symbols: ""coeffs = polyfit(r4, y4, 3)"" and ""u0 = polyval(coeffs, 0.0)"" instead of np.polyfit/np.polyval.
Placeholder left: ""def new_func(*args, **kwargs):\n    pass"" and later ""def new_func():\n    #"".",scicode_honey_openai_gpt-4_1
2,scicode,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The task specification is solvable as written: it provides a clear function signature and required inputs/outputs, fixed discretization parameters, and allowed dependencies (numpy and scipy.integrate.simpson). There is no contradiction between required methods and the environment, no missing files/APIs, and no template/harness misalignment evidenced in the trace. Although the physics is somewhat underspecified (e.g., which observation plane distance), this does not make the task impossible; a reasonable assumption (focal plane via thin-lens/Fraunhofer) suffices and the agent even produced a working implementation earlier. | causation_reasoning: The failure was caused by agent behavior/output formatting relative to the evaluation harness, not by any intrinsic benchmark deficiency. After writing a plausible implementation of simulate_light_diffraction(n,d,RL,R0,lambda_), the agent later responded to the system's extraction prompt with a different function signature `def simulate_light_diffraction():` that ignores all required inputs and returns a fabricated list, ensuring tests would fail. This is an agent capability/compliance error, not a benchmark formation issue. | evidence: The benchmark requires `def simulate_light_diffraction(n, d, RL, R0, lambda_): ... return Ie`. The agent initially wrote such a function and the user observed it producing values: ""Ie_test.shape: (51, 61)"". Later, under the system instruction ""Your response should ONLY consist of one python function... remove any dependencies or imports"", the agent output: `def simulate_light_diffraction(): ... return field`, which (a) drops required parameters and (b) returns a fabricated field. This mismatch is the proximate cause of failure.",scicode_honey_openai_gpt-4_1
35,scicode,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The benchmark instructions are internally inconsistent: it says ""Use only the following dependencies... Do not include these dependencies at the beginning of your code"" while also requiring code to be runnable in isolation. Additionally, the quadratic-combinations subtask is underspecified about whether duplicate values (degeneracies) should be kept or removed (the note only clarifies i,j,k start at 1). These are formation deficiencies because they can mislead agents about imports and expected handling of duplicates. | causation_reasoning: The agent’s run did not fail because of these deficiencies. The agent successfully implemented and unit-tested generate_quadratic_combinations, and also produced a plausible absorption implementation and test output. The eventual failure appears to be due to agent-side output/protocol issues: it returned a `final_answer(...)` call with a string instead of providing the required pure code block/function, later emitted an invalid stub `def new_func(): #`, and finally produced a different absorption implementation with disallowed behaviors (extra constants, returning list not numpy array, filtering wavelengths) inconsistent with the requested output. These are not blocked by the benchmark; a compliant agent could output the required function in the required format. | evidence: Instruction conflict: ""Use only the following dependencies in your solution. Do not include these dependencies at the beginning of your code.\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport itertools"".
Underspecification: ""NOTE: The original description is truncated - 'i,j,k are at least' is incomplete."" (duplicates handling not specified).
Agent-side protocol/output issues: the agent outputs ""final_answer(\""The `absorption` function is now correct...\"")"" instead of the required code-only response; later outputs an invalid stub ""def new_func():\n    #""; and later provides an absorption returning a Python list: ""return list(wl[:N])"" rather than the specified ""A (size N numpy array)"".",scicode_honey_openai_gpt-4_1
52,scicode,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The benchmark tasks are well-formed and solvable: function headers and mathematical requirements are clear (Schroed_deriv, SolveSchroedinger, Shoot, FindBoundStates), the allowed dependencies are sufficient (numpy, scipy.integrate/optimize), and the evaluation harness expectations are explicitly stated (respond in a ```python``` code block). No contradictory constraints or missing critical information prevents a correct solution from being produced and recognized. | causation_reasoning: The run is marked failed due to the agent’s output formatting/tool-usage error, not due to any benchmark deficiency. The agent attempted to call final_answer with a plain triple-quoted string and without providing a ```python``` code block, triggering the harness parser error. When the agent later provided code in proper ```python``` blocks, it was accepted (functions were created). Thus failure was caused by agent-side formatting/tool misuse, which is explicitly excluded from benchmark deficiency classification. | evidence: Parsing failure: ""Error in code parsing: Your code snippet is invalid, because the regex pattern ```python(.*?)``` was not found in it."" This occurred after the agent output: ""final_answer(\n\""\""\""\n...\n\""\""\""\n)```. The harness also instructs: ""It seems like you're trying to return the final answer, you can do it as follows: ```python\nfinal_answer(\""YOUR FINAL ANSWER HERE\"")\n```"".

58,scicode,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The tasks shown are well-formed and solvable in the stated environment. Function headers are clear, and the math (polytropic EOS and its inverses, plus the described TOV RHS behavior at r=0 and outside the star) is sufficiently specified for implementation. Although there is a docstring inconsistency earlier (mentioning 'eps' while requiring rho), the benchmark explicitly disambiguates it (""IMPORTANT"" note), so this is not an intrinsic underspecification. The harness also provides clear formatting requirements (triple-backtick python fences) and correct tool usage examples. | causation_reasoning: The run failed due to agent-side output/format/tool-use errors and an incorrect final submission. The agent twice attempted to call final_answer without wrapping it in a ```python ...``` block, triggering a parsing error. Later, even after producing correct implementations, the agent ended with an irrelevant placeholder function (""def new_func(): pass""), which would fail evaluation. These are not caused by any benchmark deficiency; the benchmark explicitly instructed the required format and the error message provided a correct example to follow. | evidence: Formatting/tool-use error: ""Error in code parsing: Your code snippet is invalid, because the regex pattern ```python(.*?)``` was not found in it... It seems like you're trying to return the final answer, you can do it as follows: ```python\nfinal_answer(\""YOUR FINAL ANSWER HERE\"")\n```"".
Agent incorrect final output: the run ends with ""```python\ndef new_func():\n    pass\n```"".

63,scicode,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: There are intrinsic formation issues in the benchmark/scaffold. (1) Midway through the run, the provided upstream function `construct_matrix` is explicitly a placeholder returning `D = None`, which would make the pipeline unsolvable unless the agent rewrites/ignores that provided code. The task statement says earlier steps are “integral,” yet the provided code is non-functional. (2) The benchmark later acknowledges an incorrect docstring: “IMPORTANT: NOTE: The matrix D shape in the docstring is incorrectly stated as (N_t-2) x (N_t-2). The correct shape is (N_p-2) x (N_p-2).” This is a specification inconsistency originating from the benchmark. These are formation deficiencies because they are flaws in the provided materials, independent of agent capability. | causation_reasoning: Despite the above deficiencies, the agent’s recorded failure is not caused by them. The run is marked failed due to repeated output-format violations when attempting to call `final_answer` without the required ```python ...``` wrapper, triggering the evaluator’s regex error. The trace shows multiple instances where the environment clearly instructs the correct formatting, meaning a capable agent could succeed by complying. Therefore, the proximate cause of failure is agent-side formatting/tool-usage error, not the scaffold issues. | evidence: Non-functional provided scaffold: “def construct_matrix(...): ... D = None\n    return D”.
Benchmark spec inconsistency: “IMPORTANT: NOTE: The matrix D shape in the docstring is incorrectly stated as (N_t-2) x (N_t-2). The correct shape is (N_p-2) x (N_p-2)”.
Failure cause (formatting): “Error in code parsing: Your code snippet is invalid, because the regex pattern ```python(.*?)``` was not found in it... It seems like you're trying to return the final answer, you can do it as follows: ```python\nfinal_answer(""YOUR FINAL ANSWER HERE"")\n```”.

71,scicode,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: There are intrinsic formation issues in the benchmark context. (1) Several steps’ provided starter code is internally broken/undefined (e.g., ket/tensor use an undefined `kron`; partial_trace skeleton comments out `syspermute` as “not defined” even though it exists earlier), which is misleading scaffold. (2) There is a mismatch/instability in the output-harness expectations: the harness sometimes requires a raw ```python``` code block, but later also instructs use of `final_answer(...)` inside a ```python``` block; the agent was penalized multiple times for not wrapping `final_answer` in a python fence. These are benchmark/scaffold inconsistencies that could confuse agents even if the underlying tasks are solvable. | causation_reasoning: Despite the above deficiencies, the actual failure in this run is primarily due to agent output/formatting and off-task behavior, not an impossibility imposed by the benchmark. The agent repeatedly violated the ‘final answer must be a ```python``` block’ rule by outputting `final_answer(` without a code fence, triggering parse errors. Later it also produced incomplete code (commenting that required symbols are missing) and drifted across tasks. The benchmark did provide clear corrective feedback on the required format (wrap `final_answer(""..."")` in a ```python``` block), so a capable agent could comply and succeed. Thus the proximate cause of failure was agent-side formatting/response errors, not the intrinsic scaffold flaws. | evidence: Clear format error feedback: ""Your code snippet is invalid, because the regex pattern ```python(.*?)``` was not found in it... It seems like you're trying to return the final answer, you can do it as follows: ```python\n final_answer(\""YOUR FINAL ANSWER HERE\"")\n```"". Agent repeatedly outputs `final_answer(` without a ```python``` fence: ""final_answer(\n\""\""\"" ... )```"" and gets parsing errors. Scaffold defects: ket/tensor templates use undefined `kron`: ""out = kron(out, v) #"" and ""M = kron(M, arr) # 'kron' should be defined elsewhere""; partial_trace scaffold literally says ""# syspermute is not defined"" while syspermute is provided earlier.",scicode_honey_openai_gpt-4_1
80,scicode,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The benchmark task (implementing E_pot, forces, velocity_verlet, etc.) is well-posed and solvable in the stated environment. The requirements and function headers are clear, and the allowed dependencies include numpy and math which are sufficient. The evaluation harness expectations are also clear: responses must be in a ```python``` code block, and in later stages the harness explicitly requires returning only a single python function with no imports. There is no contradiction or missing information that would block any capable agent. | causation_reasoning: The observed failure is due to agent-side output-formatting/tool-usage errors, not an intrinsic benchmark deficiency. The agent attempted to call final_answer without wrapping it in a ```python``` block and even left stray backticks, triggering the parser error. When prompted to retry with correct formatting, the agent did provide a proper ```python``` block.
