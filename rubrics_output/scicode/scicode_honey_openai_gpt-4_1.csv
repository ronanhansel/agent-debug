2,scicode,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The task is well-formed: it provides a clear function signature `simulate_light_diffraction(n, d, RL, R0, lambda_)`, fixed discretization parameters (mr2=51, ne2=61, mr0=81), allowed dependencies, and output requirements (2D intensity array). There is no contradiction between instructions and environment; numerical integration and numpy operations are supported. While some physical modeling details (e.g., observation plane distance) are underspecified, the prompt only asks to “simulate diffraction… and compute resulting intensity distribution on a plane,” leaving reasonable freedom; this does not constitute an intrinsic benchmark deficiency that would block any agent. | causation_reasoning: Failure was caused by the agent not complying with the required output: the final submission must be a single python code block implementing the specified function header. Instead, the agent attempted to call `final_answer(...)` with a text summary, then ultimately returned a different function `def simulate_light_diffraction():` with no parameters and a fabricated list-of-lists intensity. This is an agent-side formatting/spec mismatch, not something induced by the benchmark. A correct submission format was possible (and the agent even wrote a plausible correct implementation earlier), so no intrinsic deficiency caused the failure. | evidence: Prompt required exact header: ""def simulate_light_diffraction(n, d, RL, R0, lambda_):"" and ""Write the complete and executable Python program... Ensure your response is in the format of ```python```"".
Agent final output violated this: ""def simulate_light_diffraction(): ... return field"" (missing required parameters and not numpy array).
Agent also output non-solution text via tool call: ""final_answer( 'The implementation is correct...')"".
System then instructed: ""returns only a python function... remove any dependencies or imports... ONLY consist of one python function"", after which agent still returned the wrong signature and fabricated data.",scicode_honey_openai_gpt-4_1
35,scicode,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The benchmark/task text is internally underspecified for `generate_quadratic_combinations`: it does not state whether the “smallest N quadratic combinations” should include multiplicities (counting different (i,j,k) that yield the same value) or should be unique values. The agent notes this ambiguity (“Values may repeat… so duplicates should be treated correctly (depending on whether we allow repeats...)”), and later chooses `set()`/`np.unique`, enforcing uniqueness. Additionally, the run transcript shows the task context repeatedly shifting (ground_state_wavelength -> generate_quadratic_combinations -> absorption) without a clean separation, which can indicate harness/context issues. However, these deficiencies do not make the task impossible; a capable agent can still implement a valid interpretation and usually pass if the grader matches that interpretation. | causation_reasoning: The recorded failure is not shown to be caused by the underspecification. The agent successfully implemented and tested `generate_quadratic_combinations`, and later implemented an `absorption` function and tested it. The run is marked failed, but the most salient agent-side issues are output/interaction errors: the agent produced an invalid stub (`def new_func():\n    #`) after the user printed a function object, and later provided `final_answer` as a string rather than returning the required code block, and also violated dependency rules in later code (imports inside function, extra constants, different formulas/filters). These are agent capability/compliance failures rather than intrinsic benchmark formation deficiencies. There is no evidence that the grader rejected a correct solution due to the ambiguity (e.g., producing correct-but-rejected values). | evidence: Underspecification acknowledged: “Values may repeat ... so duplicates should be treated correctly (depending on whether we allow repeats in the output or want unique results).” Task note: “NOTE: The original description is truncated - 'i,j,k are at least' is incomplete.” Agent-enforced uniqueness: `combs = set()` and later `np.unique(transitions)`. Agent-side failure-like behavior: after user prints function object, agent outputs invalid code: ```python\ndef new_func():\n    #\n```; later responds with `final_answer(""The `absorption` function is now correct..."" )` instead of providing just the required code block; and later `absorption` implementation diverges from given constants/requirements (uses `e`, `1240/delta_E`, wavelength filtering, returns list not numpy array).",scicode_honey_openai_gpt-4_1
52,scicode,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The benchmark task itself is well-formed and solvable in the stated environment: it provides clear function headers, allows appropriate dependencies (numpy, scipy.integrate/optimize), and the required operations (ODE integration, Simpson normalization, root finding) are available. While there is some ambiguity about the ordering of R (“Start the integration from large r”), this does not make the task impossible: an agent can integrate using the provided R ordering or reverse it, and either approach can be made consistent with solve_ivp. No template/harness contradiction prevents a correct solution from being recognized; later, the system explicitly instructs to output only a single python function without imports, indicating the evaluation wrapper’s expectations. | causation_reasoning: The run failed due to agent output/formatting errors, not benchmark formation. The agent attempted to call final_answer with prose and/or without the required ```python``` code-fence wrapper, triggering the harness regex failure. This is explicitly called out by the framework as an agent-side formatting issue, and the error message provided a viable correct format. The underlying coding tasks (SolveSchroedinger/Shoot/FindBoundStates) were implemented and even unit-tested successfully in the trace, indicating solvability absent the formatting mistake. | evidence: Harness error: ""Error in code parsing: Your code snippet is invalid, because the regex pattern ```python(.*?)``` was not found in it."" Occurred after agent response: ""final_answer(\n\""\""\"" ... \""\""\""\n)```. The harness also gave corrective instruction: ""It seems like you're trying to return the final answer, you can do it as follows:```python\nfinal_answer(\""YOUR FINAL ANSWER HERE\"")\n```"".

58,scicode,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: There is an intrinsic inconsistency in the benchmark spec for the TOV RHS step: the prompt instructs the agent to ""Use the functions `eps_from_press` and `rho_from_press`"", while the actually provided/previously implemented helper functions are named `eos_eps_from_press` and `eos_rho_from_press` (and earlier code also uses `eos_press_from_rho`). This mismatch can mislead an agent about which functions exist in scope and what names the grader expects. Additionally, the run shows multiple meta-instructions/harness layers that require responses to be wrapped in ```python ...``` blocks and not to call `final_answer(...)` as raw text; that requirement is clear but contributes to fragility. | causation_reasoning: The agent did not fail because of the naming inconsistency; they worked around it by defining local `rho_from_press` and `eps_from_press` inside `tov_RHS`, and produced a plausible `tov_RHS` implementation. The terminal failure is due to the agent outputting an obviously wrong final response (`def new_func(): pass`) after previously having produced correct-looking code. Earlier, the agent also repeatedly triggered a formatting/parsing error by emitting `final_answer(` without wrapping it in a ```python``` code fence, and the framework explicitly told them how to format it. These are agent-side output/formatting/behavior errors, not an impossible benchmark condition. Therefore the intrinsic deficiency did not cause this run’s failure. | evidence: Spec inconsistency: ""Use the functions `eps_from_press` and `rho_from_press`"" vs earlier defined functions `eos_eps_from_press` and `eos_rho_from_press` (e.g., user task section shows: ""def eos_eps_from_press(press, eos_Gamma, eos_kappa): ..."").
Agent-side parsing failure: ""Error in code parsing: ... regex pattern ```python(.*?)``` was not found in it ... It seems like you're trying to return the final answer, you can do it as follows: ```python\nfinal_answer(\""YOUR FINAL ANSWER HERE\"")\n```"".

63,scicode,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: There are intrinsic benchmark/scaffolding issues: (1) the benchmark later injects a `construct_matrix` that explicitly returns `D = None` (a placeholder) while simultaneously requiring a functioning recursive matrix for later steps. This is a template/scaffolding misalignment because a correct later solution depends on a prior step being non-placeholder, but the provided code contradicts that. (2) the forward_iteration docstring is acknowledged by the benchmark itself to contain an incorrect matrix shape: ""IMPORTANT: NOTE: The matrix D shape in the docstring is incorrectly stated as (N_t-2) x (N_t-2)."" These are genuine formation defects in the task materials. | causation_reasoning: Despite the existence of deficiencies, the run’s recorded failure is not caused by them. The agent repeatedly fails due to output-formatting/tool-usage errors (calling `final_answer(...)` without wrapping in a ```python``` code fence) and, at other points, by producing an incorrect numerical implementation (finite-difference result near 0 vs Black-Scholes ~10.45) before later revisions. The benchmark clearly indicates the required formatting and the agent could have complied; this is an agent capability/output compliance issue. Additionally, the final user-facing code block does provide a function, so the immediate failure flag is best explained by the agent’s formatting/tool misuse earlier rather than an impossible benchmark requirement. | evidence: Formation defects:
- Placeholder prior-step code: ""def construct_matrix(...): ... D = None\n    return D"".
- Docstring mismatch acknowledged: ""IMPORTANT**: NOTE: The matrix D shape in the docstring is incorrectly stated as (N_t-2) x (N_t-2). The correct shape is (N_p-2) x (N_p-2)"".

Failure not caused by these:
- Parsing/formatting failure: ""Error in code parsing: Your code snippet is invalid, because the regex pattern ```python(.*?)``` was not found in it."" (triggered by agent outputting `final_answer(`...`)` without code fence).

- The error message also provides a compliant alternative, showing it was recoverable by proper formatting: ""It seems like you're trying to return the final answer, you can do it as follows: ```python\nfinal_answer(\""YOUR FINAL ANSWER HERE\"")\n```""",scicode_honey_openai_gpt-4_1
80,scicode,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The core programming tasks shown (implementing dist, E_ij, E_pot, forces, velocity_verlet, etc.) are well-posed and solvable in the stated environment. The prompt’s required output format is consistent (responses must be in a ```python``` code block), and the tool feedback clearly explains the formatting requirement when violated. There is no structural contradiction (e.g., impossible dependencies, mismatched function signatures, or broken scaffolding) that would prevent any competent agent from succeeding. | causation_reasoning: The run’s failure is attributable to agent-side formatting/tool-usage errors, not benchmark formation issues. The agent attempted to call final_answer without wrapping it in a ```python``` code fence and even left stray backticks, triggering the parser error. After receiving explicit corrective instructions, the agent was able to continue producing correct code blocks, indicating the benchmark was executable and not intrinsically defective. | evidence: Failure message: ""Error in code parsing: Your code snippet is invalid, because the regex pattern ```python(.*?)``` was not found in it.\nHere is your code snippet: final_answer(\""...\"")```"" and the system instruction: ""It seems like you're trying to return the final answer, you can do it as follows:\n```python\nfinal_answer(\""YOUR FINAL ANSWER HERE\"")\n```"".

71,scicode,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The benchmark materials contain multiple intrinsic inconsistencies/misalignments: (1) earlier provided starter implementations call an undefined symbol `kron` (e.g., in `ket` and `tensor`), which would break downstream tasks if relied upon; (2) the prompt repeatedly says ""Function header has no parameters"" while showing `def tensor(*args):`, indicating confusion in the benchmark text; (3) there is an evaluation-harness expectation that final responses include a ```python code fence, which is not always aligned with the tool-based `final_answer()` usage, creating a trap for agents. These are formation deficiencies because they originate in the benchmark scaffolding and could mislead/impede otherwise capable agents. | causation_reasoning: Despite the deficiencies, the agent’s failure here was not caused by them. The agent successfully produced working code for several steps and passed tool-based tests. The terminal failure happened because the agent repeatedly attempted to return the final answer in an invalid format (missing the required ```python fenced block, and later an unterminated triple-quoted string), which the system explicitly instructed how to fix. This is an agent output-formatting error (explicitly excluded by the rubric) rather than an unavoidable benchmark defect. | evidence: Benchmark defects:
- `ket`: ""for v in vectors[1:]:\n        out = kron(out, v) #"" (undefined `kron`).
- `tensor`: ""for arr in arrays[1:]:\n        M = kron(M, arr) # 'kron' should be defined elsewhere or replaced"".
- Prompt inconsistency: ""**NOTE**: Function header has no parameters but test cases call tensor([0,1],[0,1])..."" while header is `def tensor(*args):`.

Failure cause (agent formatting):
- System error: ""regex pattern ```python(.*?)``` was not found"" after agent returned `final_answer(...)` without a python code fence.
- Later error: ""SyntaxError: unterminated triple-quoted string literal"" when agent wrapped large code inside triple quotes in `final_answer`.

12,scicode,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: There are intrinsic issues in the benchmark scaffolding/harness. The run shows multiple inconsistent expectations about what code should be returned (sometimes one function only, sometimes a full program), and a restrictive execution policy that can reject calling helper functions unless defined in the same snippet, even when the task text says prior-step functions are available. Example: the harness throws “Forbidden function evaluation” for `numerov` despite it being part of the benchmark’s intended multi-step dependency chain. Also, later the agent is prompted by a system tool to “return only one python function” while other steps request multiple functions or rely on shared state, indicating misalignment between evaluation apparatus and prompt structure. | causation_reasoning: Despite those deficiencies, the specific run’s final failure is not shown to be caused by them. After the harness error about missing ```python``` fences, the agent does retry and provides code in the correct fenced format. The trace ends with the overall run marked failed, but without a definitive final blocking harness error that prevented completion of the last required step. Additionally, many failures are agent-caused: e.g., the agent produced an incorrect `extrapolate_polyfit` version using undefined `polyfit`/`polyval` (should be `np.polyfit`/`np.polyval`) and omitted required imports (`np` referenced without import in some versions). The agent also produced a placeholder `new_func` and inconsistently followed “do not include previous function code” instructions, suggesting implementation/formatting issues contributed materially. | evidence: Harness restriction evidence: “InterpreterError: Forbidden function evaluation: 'numerov' is not among the explicitly allowed tools or defined/imported in the preceding code”.
Scaffolding inconsistency evidence: system instruction: “You are a tool… Your response should ONLY consist of one python function… Please remove any dependencies or imports…” while the benchmark earlier requests “Write the complete and executable Python program…”.
Agent-caused bug evidence: the agent’s `extrapolate_polyfit` version: “coeffs = polyfit(r4, y4, 3)
    u0 = polyval(coeffs, 0.0)” (polyfit/polyval undefined).
