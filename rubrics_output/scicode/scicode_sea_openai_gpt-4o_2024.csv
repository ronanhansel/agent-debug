12,scicode,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: Across multiple steps the benchmark/task text is internally underspecified or inconsistent about physical units and required interfaces, and later steps appear to drift/overwrite earlier step requirements without clear state boundaries. Example: early functions compute f(r) using SI constants (hbar, m_e, epsilon_0) but the task never specifies the unit system for r_grid or energy (the agent guessed eV and later converted to Joules). This is a real formation issue because many different, incompatible conventions (atomic units vs SI, r in bohr vs meters, energy in eV vs Hartree/Ry) would all be plausible. Additionally, the 'next step' repeatedly changes (Numerov, compute_Schrod, shoot, find_bound_states, sort_states, calculate_charge_density, etc.) suggesting template/state misalignment in the benchmark conversation rather than a single well-scoped coding task. | causation_reasoning: Despite the above deficiencies, the run is marked failed primarily due to agent-side errors (formatting violations and incorrect/placeholder implementations) rather than an impossible benchmark. The environment gave explicit formatting requirements (must include a ```python``` block) and the agent repeatedly responded with prose, triggering parsing errors; those are explicitly excluded from deficiency scoring. Later, the agent introduced placeholders inside required functions (e.g., redefining compute_Schrod_Hartree or extrapolate_polyfit as pass), which would fail any evaluation regardless of benchmark quality. Also, the final function definitions (e.g., scf_routine) omit required imports and reference undefined names (simpson, np) in the stripped final version, indicating implementation mistakes. Therefore the intrinsic deficiency did not proximately cause this specific failure. | evidence: Formatting/parsing failures: ""Error in code parsing: Your code snippet is invalid, because the regex pattern ```python(.*?)``` was not found in it."" occurs multiple times (e.g., after T0B9, T0B22, T0B45, etc.). Unit underspecification: task never states units for r_grid/energy; agent guessed ""energy in eV"" then converted using electron_volt and got unrealistic magnitudes (e.g., f(r) ~ 1e39 then ~1e20). Placeholder/incorrect implementations: assistant output defines stubs: ""def compute_Schrod_Hartree(...): pass"" inside extrapolate_polyfit (T0B213) and ""def extrapolate_polyfit(...): pass"" inside find_bound_states_Hartree (T0B216), which would break evaluation. Undefined references in final stripped functions: final scf_routine shown without imports uses np/simpson but they are not defined in that snippet (T0B272).",scicode_sea_openai_gpt-4o_2024
2,scicode,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The task is solvable as stated: implement a function returning a 2D intensity array using given discretization parameters. No contradictory constraints or missing dependencies prevent implementation. While the physical model is underspecified (e.g., propagation distance/observation plane not defined), the benchmark asks generally for an intensity distribution and does not specify a unique numeric target, so this does not inherently block all agents from producing an acceptable implementation. The provided dependency shims are consistent, and the environment supports numpy/scipy. | causation_reasoning: The run failed due to agent-side issues: (1) incorrect array-shape handling in the first implementation caused a broadcasting error, and (2) later the agent produced invalid code structure when asked to output only a single function (nested duplicate function header and indentation error). These are not caused by the benchmark formation; a competent agent could implement consistent grids and provide a single valid function per instructions. | evidence: Broadcasting bug from agent code: ""ValueError: operands could not be broadcast together with shapes (81,61) (61,51)"" at call to simulate_light_diffraction.
Formatting/parsing issue is agent-side: ""regex pattern ```python(.*?)``` was not found"" after the assistant replied with prose plus stray backticks.
Final function-only step: assistant output contains an invalid nested definition: ""def simulate_light_diffraction(n, d, RL, R0, lambda_):\n    def simulate_light_diffraction(n, d, RL, R0, lambda_):"" which is syntactically/structurally wrong per system instruction to output one function.",scicode_sea_openai_gpt-4o_2024
28,scicode,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: There are intrinsic issues in the benchmark materials: (1) Dependency/spec mismatch: the prompt allows/requests `from scipy.integrate import simpson` but the provided earlier code and the agent’s environment errors show `simpson` was not available unless explicitly imported within the snippet, and later the agent was forced to use `np.trapz` even though the notes say to use `np.trapezoid`. This indicates misalignment between stated allowed deps and the execution harness. (2) Underspecification of optics system: `gaussian_beam_through_lens` signature includes `Mp2`, `L1`, and `s` but the task does not define how these participate in the ABCD chain; any correct implementation depends on a specific optical layout that is not fully specified. (3) Output shape inconsistency: initial beam function spec says outputs are (N+1, N+1) but typical FFT grids are N×N; this mismatch can confuse grading if strict. These are benchmark-formation deficiencies because they originate from the task spec/environment, not agent choices. | causation_reasoning: The run is marked failed, but the proximate causes are agent-side: repeated violations of the required response format during intermediate steps, and incorrect/physically invalid implementation of `gaussian_beam_through_lens` producing all-NaN outputs. The NaNs are due to the agent’s misuse of the complex beam parameter (e.g., treating q as `R0 + i Z_R` and then not incorporating z correctly; later trying a formula that still yields NaNs), not because the task is impossible. A capable agent could implement a consistent ABCD propagation with a reasonable interpretation of the system and avoid NaNs. The dependency misalignment (simpson import) caused an error during an optional energy-check test, but the core required deliverable was function code; this did not block completion. Therefore the intrinsic deficiencies did not cause this specific failure. | evidence: Dependency/harness mismatch: ""InterpreterError: Forbidden function evaluation: 'simpson' is not among the explicitly allowed tools or defined/imported in the preceding code"" after using simpson.
Underspecification: function signature includes ""Mp2"", ""L1"", ""s"" but prompt provides no explicit ABCD chain using these.
Agent incorrect result: unit test output ""Beam waist sizes at propagation distances z: [nan nan nan nan nan]"".
Formatting failures: multiple occurrences of ""regex pattern ```python(.*?)``` was not found"".
Spec inconsistency: prompt says outputs should be ""(N+1, N+1)"" while agent implemented and tested (256,256).",scicode_sea_openai_gpt-4o_2024
35,scicode,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The benchmark conversation/harness appears to be mis-scaffolded: (a) it repeatedly enforces a regex that expects a ```python fenced code block even when the agent is providing plain-text narration (""regex pattern ```python(.*?)``` was not found""), and (b) later a separate ""tool"" instruction says it will ""return only a python function"" and to ""remove any dependencies or imports"", which conflicts with earlier task instructions that required code in a full program block and earlier dependencies guidance. Additionally, the task text itself becomes corrupted mid-run (a nested, improperly indented duplicate definition: ""def ground_state_wavelength(L, mr):\n    def ground_state_wavelength(L, mr):""), indicating benchmark-provided content/accumulated history is malformed. These are intrinsic issues in the benchmark trace/evaluation apparatus rather than the physics/math problem itself. | causation_reasoning: Despite the scaffold issues, the agent did produce a correct implementation for the requested function(s) at multiple points. The run is marked failed because the agent ultimately responded with irrelevant code (a helper function `check_all_or_any`) instead of the required target function, and also repeatedly emitted non-code narration when the harness expected fenced code. Those are agent-side output/format compliance and task-following errors, not an unavoidable benchmark impossibility. A capable agent could succeed by consistently outputting the required final function in a ```python block. Therefore, the intrinsic deficiencies did not proximately cause the failure. | evidence: Intrinsic issues: (1) Harness parsing error: ""Error in code parsing: Your code snippet is invalid, because the regex pattern ```python(.*?)``` was not found in it."" (appears multiple times). (2) Corrupted provided code: ""def ground_state_wavelength(L, mr):\n    def ground_state_wavelength(L, mr):"" in the task text. (3) Conflicting system instruction: ""returns only a python function... remove any dependencies or imports"" vs earlier requirement to provide a complete program and earlier dependency notes.
Agent-caused failure: Final assistant output is unrelated: ""def check_all_or_any(array, condition='all')"" instead of implementing the required benchmark function; plus repeated narration outside code fences triggered parsing errors.",scicode_sea_openai_gpt-4o_2024
52,scicode,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The benchmark tasks are well-formed and solvable: each step provides a clear function header, required behavior, and allowed dependencies. The repeated parsing errors are due to the agent returning non-code text when the harness expects a ```python ...``` block, which is explicitly covered by the rubric as an agent formatting issue, not a benchmark formation deficiency. No contradictory requirements, missing dependencies, broken templates, or impossible-to-satisfy constraints are evident. | causation_reasoning: The agent's failures stem from output-format noncompliance (missing the required ```python``` fence) during intermediate turns, triggering the harness regex error. When the agent did provide code in the correct format, execution succeeded (functions defined, tests ran). Thus, there is no intrinsic benchmark deficiency causing failure; it is an agent capability/formatting issue. | evidence: Multiple harness errors: ""Error in code parsing: Your code snippet is invalid, because the regex pattern ```python(.*?)``` was not found in it."" This occurred after agent produced prose like: ""The function `Schroed_deriv` was successfully defined..."" and similarly for SolveSchroedinger/Shoot/FindBoundStates. In contrast, when the agent responded with fenced code (e.g., ""```python\nimport numpy as np\n...def Schroed_deriv...```""), the tool executed successfully (e.g., output ""[ 0. -3.]"" and later printed normalized wavefunction), showing the task itself was executable and not blocked by benchmark construction.",scicode_sea_openai_gpt-4o_2024
58,scicode,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: There are intrinsic benchmark formation problems: (1) the prompt for eos_rho_from_press contains a contradictory docstring/output label (it says output is eps, but the task says return rho), which is an underspecification/contradiction. (2) later, the task statement becomes internally inconsistent and appears corrupted: it includes an unrelated placeholder `def new_func(): pass` under the section that should define eos_rho_from_press, and then asks for eos_eps_from_press while also saying “compute specific internal energy given density” but the header is from pressure. These are task text/scaffolding defects that could confuse an agent about what function to implement. | causation_reasoning: Despite the deficiencies, the agent successfully implemented the requested EOS conversion functions when clearly specified (eos_press_from_rho, eos_rho_from_press, eos_eps_from_press). The run is marked failed primarily due to the agent repeatedly outputting non-code prose where the harness required a ```python``` code block (a formatting/output-protocol error explicitly excluded by the rubric) and then later going off-task into implementing TOV/tov_RHS/tov, which was not requested in the initial step. Thus, failure is attributable to agent behavior (formatting and task drift), not an unavoidable benchmark barrier. | evidence: Formation issues: prompt contradiction: “**IMPORTANT**: ... returns DENSITY (rho) ... Despite the docstring mentioning 'eps'” and the header shows “Outputs: eps... return rho”. Corrupted/misaligned later prompt: “def new_func(): pass” appears where eos_rho_from_press should be, and mixed instruction: “compute specific internal energy given density” but “Implement the eos_eps_from_press... from pressure”.
Failure cause agent-side: repeated harness errors: “Error in code parsing: ... regex pattern ```python(.*?)``` was not found” after agent outputs prose (e.g., T0B10, T0B22, T0B35, T0B51, T0B60, T0B68, T0B92, T0B101).

63,scicode,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The benchmark/run context shows a structural misalignment: after the agent correctly implemented `initialize_grid`, the harness/system later redefined the task and forced a ""tool that receives a block of text and python code and returns only a python function"" constraint, causing the conversation to drift and overwrite function signatures (e.g., `initialize_grid` changed from the specified header to `def initialize_grid(S_max, S_min, N, T_max, M)`). This indicates the evaluation/scaffolding is not stable across steps and can replace the intended function header/requirements. Additionally, multiple points show the harness requiring strict ```python fences and failing parsing otherwise, which is clear but contributes to fragility. These are intrinsic issues with the benchmark scaffolding/state management rather than the mathematical task itself. | causation_reasoning: Despite the scaffolding issues, the final recorded failure is not caused by the benchmark being impossible; it is caused by agent-side errors: (1) repeated output-format violations (missing ```python block) and (2) producing incorrect final code (e.g., nested duplicate `forward_iteration` definition and later switching to an unrelated `apply_boundary_conditions(grid, boundary_conditions)` signature). Also, when a full pricing function was attempted, the numeric blow-up and earlier dimension mismatch reflect implementation/modeling mistakes rather than an unavoidable benchmark deficiency. A capable agent could still complete the requested `forward_iteration` function within the provided constraints. | evidence: Scaffolding misalignment/state drift: system instruction changed context: ""You are a tool that receives a block of text and python code and returns only a python function"" (T0B19), after which `initialize_grid` was rewritten with a different signature: `def initialize_grid(S_max, S_min, N, T_max, M)` (T0B21) instead of the original header `def initialize_grid(price_step, time_step, strike, max_price, min_price)`.
Agent formatting failures: ""regex pattern ```python(.*?)``` was not found"" (T0B10, T0B30, T0B49, T0B64, T0B74, T0B86, T0B105, T0B114).

71,scicode,1.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The benchmark’s provided earlier-step code for `apply_channel` is intrinsically flawed/misaligned: it enforces an invalid constraint `if len(dim) != len(set(sys))` which rejects valid use-cases where a channel acts on a strict subset of subsystems (e.g., `dim=[2,2]`, `sys=[0]`). This makes the later tasks (computing neg_rev_coh_info and then optimizing it in `GADC_rev_coh_inf`) unsolvable for any agent without modifying the provided `apply_channel`, which the benchmark structure typically disallows because earlier functions are assumed correct dependencies. | causation_reasoning: The agent’s final target `GADC_rev_coh_inf` is mathematically fine, but executing it necessarily calls `neg_rev_coh_info`, which calls `apply_channel(..., sys=[0], dim=[2,2])`. Because the benchmark’s `apply_channel` throws an exception for this valid input, the run fails regardless of the agent’s implementation of `GADC_rev_coh_inf`. Thus the intrinsic deficiency in the benchmark dependency (`apply_channel`) is the proximate cause of failure. | evidence: `apply_channel` validation: `if len(dim) != len(set(sys)):
        raise ValueError(""The length of 'dim' and 'sys' must match or be compatible."")`.

80,scicode,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The benchmark instructions and environment are internally consistent and solvable. The task expects a single function implementation in a ```python``` block and the harness clearly enforces this via an explicit regex error message.

Repeatedly, the agent output plain prose when the harness required a ```python``` code block, triggering parsing errors. Additionally, the agent produced incorrect final code in some steps (e.g., wrong `dist` signature; incorrect `E_pot` implementation; nested/duplicated `f_ij`), indicating implementation mistakes independent of the benchmark.
