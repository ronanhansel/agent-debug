Without the parent class, expected method name, parameters, or intended functionality, the task is intrinsically underspecified: multiple incompatible functions could be produced and no agent can reliably infer the correct implementation from the provided text alone. | causation_reasoning: Despite the underspecification, the agent's failure is primarily due to violating the system instruction to output ONLY one python function. The agent output three separate code blocks/functions (required_function, required_method, method_must_be_implemented_in_child_classes). This is an agent-side formatting/compliance error that would cause failure regardless of the task ambiguity. A capable agent could still comply by outputting exactly one placeholder function, even if the true intended function is unknown. | evidence: User input contains only: ""# Error occurred: This method must be implemented in child classes\n# Please implement the required function manually"" (no signature or context). System instruction: ""Your response should ONLY consist of one python function.""

2,scicode,1.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The benchmark input provides no code, no function signature, and no specification of what function to implement. The system instruction requires returning exactly one Python function without changing functionality, but there is no source code/function body to transform and no required interface described. This is an intrinsic formation deficiency: the task is underspecified and cannot be completed by any agent because the required function is not identifiable. | causation_reasoning: The agent failure follows directly from the absence of any implementable method details. Since the only user content is an error message (“This method must be implemented in child classes”) with no accompanying class/method definition or expected behavior, any produced function would be arbitrary and unverifiable. Thus the deficiency is the proximate cause of failure. | evidence: User input contains only: ""# Error occurred: This method must be implemented in child classes\n# Please implement the required function manually"" and no other code/spec.

28,scicode,1.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The task provides no actual code or function signature to implement—only an error message stating that a method must be implemented in child classes. With no parent class, abstract method name, expected signature, or surrounding context, the benchmark input is structurally incomplete: an agent cannot produce the required single Python function without inventing details. | causation_reasoning: The agent failed because there was nothing concrete to implement. Any attempt would require guessing the function name/signature, which would not reliably match the hidden evaluator. Thus the failure is directly attributable to the benchmark providing only an error stub rather than the necessary scaffold/code to repair. | evidence: User input contains only: ""# Error occurred: This method must be implemented in child classes\n# Please implement the required function manually"" and no other code, classes, method name, or required interface is provided.

35,scicode,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The provided prompt context contains no solvable specification beyond an error message: it asks to ""implement the required function manually"" but does not describe what the function should do, its signature, or expected behavior. However, this appears to be the actual task content for this benchmark instance rather than a mismatch in templates or environment. There is no evidence of contradictory constraints, missing dependencies, or scaffold misalignment—just an underspecified user request that the agent could have handled by producing a stub or asking for clarification (though asking may be disallowed). Given the rubric focus on intrinsic benchmark formation issues, the trace alone does not demonstrate that the benchmark expected a specific behavior that was impossible to infer; it only shows the agent returning the same NotImplementedError stub. | causation_reasoning: The agent failed because it did not implement any meaningful functionality; it simply re-raised NotImplementedError in `required_function`, which would fail any tests expecting real behavior. Even if the task was underspecified, a capable agent might attempt a generic implementation based on additional hidden context (e.g., template/tests) or infer the required function name/signature from provided code—none of which is present in the trace. With only this trace, the failure is attributable to agent-side non-implementation rather than a demonstrated benchmark deficiency that would block all agents. | evidence: User message: ""# Error occurred: This method must be implemented in child classes\n# Please implement the required function manually"". Agent output: `def required_function(*args, **kwargs):\n    raise NotImplementedError(""This method must be implemented in child classes"")`.

52,scicode,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The benchmark input provides no actual code context (no class, no signature requirements, no expected behavior beyond a generic error message). The user content is only: ""# Error occurred: This method must be implemented in child classes\n# Please implement the required function manually"". Without the original template or required method name/signature, the task is underspecified and multiple implementations could be ""correct"" depending on the missing context. | causation_reasoning: Even though the task is underspecified, the agent's produced function does not implement anything; it simply re-raises NotImplementedError. That directly contradicts ""Please implement the required function manually"" and would fail regardless of missing context. So the proximate cause of failure is the agent output (non-implementation), not the benchmark deficiency. | evidence: User prompt contains only an error message: ""# Error occurred: This method must be implemented in child classes\n# Please implement the required function manually"".

58,scicode,1.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The benchmark input provides no actual code context, function signature, class name, or required behavior—only an error message stating an abstract method must be implemented. Without the parent class/interface or the name/signature of the required method, the task is intrinsically underspecified: a correct implementation cannot be derived from the provided materials, and any agent would be forced to guess. | causation_reasoning: The agent failed because the task did not specify what to implement. The agent responded with placeholder functions (`required_function` / `required_method`) containing `pass`, which is a direct consequence of missing requirements. With the necessary context (expected function name/signature and intended behavior), the agent could have implemented it; as given, no correct solution is possible. | evidence: User input contains only: ""# Error occurred: This method must be implemented in child classes\n# Please implement the required function manually"" with no additional code/template.

Without the parent class, expected method name/signature, or required behavior, the task is intrinsically underspecified and cannot be solved in a verifiable way by any agent. | causation_reasoning: The agent failed because the prompt did not provide the required function details. As a result, the agent could only create a placeholder that raises NotImplementedError, which necessarily fails any hidden tests expecting real functionality. With a proper specification, a capable agent could implement it; here, success is blocked by missing benchmark content. | evidence: User input: ""# Error occurred: This method must be implemented in child classes\n# Please implement the required function manually"".

71,scicode,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The user input provides no code context, function name, signature, or required behavior beyond the generic message ""This method must be implemented in child classes"" and ""Please implement the required function manually"". This is intrinsically underspecified: multiple mutually incompatible implementations could be valid, and the benchmark gives no way to infer what the evaluator expects (e.g., exact name/signature/logic). That is a formation deficiency in the task prompt because it withholds necessary requirements for a determinate solution. | causation_reasoning: Despite the underspecification, the agent also violated the system instruction that the response should ""ONLY consist of one python function"". The trace shows the agent outputting four separate code blocks/functions across multiple assistant messages (required_method, required_function with pass, required_function with *args/**kwargs, required_function raising NotImplementedError). This formatting/structure violation is an agent-side failure independent of the benchmark deficiency; even with a well-specified task, multiple functions/blocks would fail the stated output constraint. | evidence: Underspecified prompt: user only provided ""# Error occurred: This method must be implemented in child classes\n# Please implement the required function manually"" with no API details. Output constraint: system says ""Your response should ONLY consist of one python function.""

It does not name the method, required signature, expected behavior, or surrounding class/context. This is an intrinsic underspecification: a capable agent cannot implement the correct method without the missing details. | causation_reasoning: Although the task is underspecified, the agent's output simply reintroduced the same NotImplementedError, rather than implementing any behavior. The immediate failure is attributable to the agent not providing an implementation (it kept the placeholder behavior). Even with underspecification, the agent could have attempted a best-effort concrete implementation if any context existed; here, the agent made no attempt beyond restating the error. | evidence: User input contains only: ""# Error occurred: This method must be implemented in child classes\n# Please implement the required function manually"" with no function name, signature, or requirements.
