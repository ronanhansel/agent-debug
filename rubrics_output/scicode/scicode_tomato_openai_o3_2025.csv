2,scicode,1.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The benchmark's dependency specification is internally inconsistent with the execution environment. It instructs solutions to use a shim that defines `scipy.integrate.simps` if missing, and then to `from scipy.integrate import simps`. However, the environment error shows `scipy.integrate` lacks `simps`, meaning the grading/runtime likely imports `simps` before (or without) executing the shim, or the shim is not actually present/applied in the interpreter context. This makes a standards-compliant solution (following the provided dependency block) fail at import time, i.e., a structural benchmark/environment mismatch. | causation_reasoning: The agent's run failed when attempting to follow the stated dependencies: importing `simps` raised an InterpreterError. That failure is directly attributable to the benchmark's reliance on a shim that is apparently not effective in the actual execution environment. Although the agent later tried to avoid SciPy imports, the observed failure point in the run is explicitly the missing `simps` attribute, which would also break any agent implementing the solution as instructed. Therefore the intrinsic deficiency both exists and caused the failure. | evidence: Execution error: ""Code execution failed at line 'from scipy.integrate import simps' due to: InterpreterError: Module scipy.integrate has no attribute simps"". Benchmark-provided dependency instructions: ""# Compatibility shim for scipy.integrate.simps ... import scipy.integrate; if not hasattr(scipy.integrate, 'simps'): scipy.integrate.simps = scipy.integrate.simpson ... from scipy.integrate import simps"".",scicode_tomato_openai_o3_2025
35,scicode,1.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The run shows an evaluation/parsing harness that, at least in some turns, requires code to be wrapped in a literal `<code>...</code>` block (regex `<code>(.*?)</code>`), which conflicts with the benchmark instruction to answer in a markdown ```python``` block. This is a structural mismatch between required output format and the evaluator's parser. Additionally, the task text claims only `numpy` and `itertools` are allowed, but the execution environment allows many other imports while disallowing `heapq`; this inconsistency can mislead agents about permissible tooling, though it is secondary to the parsing mismatch. | causation_reasoning: The agent's actual solution code for the requested functions was produced and syntactically valid multiple times, but the run was marked failed after the harness rejected a snippet purely due to formatting: it could not find the `<code>...</code>` pattern and errored on the agent output `0.9</code>` / `0.71</code>`. This indicates the proximate cause of failure was the benchmark/evaluator formatting requirement, not the algorithmic solution. A perfect agent could still be tripped by the inconsistent required wrapper if not disclosed, making the deficiency causative here. | evidence: Parsing failure: ""Error in code parsing: Your code snippet is invalid, because the regex pattern <code>(.*?)</code> was not found in it. Here is your code snippet: 0.9</code>"" (also earlier with ""0.71</code>""). Conflicting response spec: prompt says ""Ensure your response is in the format of ```python```"" while evaluator later enforces `<code>...</code>` wrapper.

28,scicode,1.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The benchmark/evaluation harness requires responses to include a literal ""<code>...</code>"" wrapper (per the parser error message), but the task instructions and response guidelines require output in Markdown triple backticks (```python) and later even a system instruction says to output only a python function in a ```python``` block. These are structurally conflicting output-format requirements imposed by the benchmark setup, meaning a correct solution can be rejected purely due to formatting even if the code is correct. | causation_reasoning: The agent produced valid Python code for the required function multiple times, but the run failed when the agent responded with prose instead of a code blob, triggering the harness regex error. This failure mode is directly tied to the harness's rigid requirement for a <code>...</code> pattern, which is inconsistent with earlier benchmark instructions (triple backticks). Even though the agent later complied, the recorded failure was caused by the formatting/parser constraint rather than an algorithmic impossibility. A corrected benchmark (consistent expected wrapper or tolerant parser) would not have failed on a correct code submission. | evidence: Harness error: ""Error in code parsing: Your code snippet is invalid, because the regex pattern <code>(.*?)</code> was not found in it."" It then instructs: ""Make sure to include code with the correct pattern ... <code>\n# Your python code here\n</code>"".

52,scicode,1.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The benchmark/harness introduces contradictory formatting/execution requirements that can break otherwise-correct solutions. The task instructions say not to include imports and to output only the requested function, but the agent is repeatedly prompted to provide full code blocks with imports. Later, a system message explicitly rewrites/strips imports and forces returning ONLY ONE function, which makes earlier functions depend on unavailable globals (e.g., np, integrate, optimize) when the harness expects them. This is an intrinsic scaffolding/evaluation misalignment: the benchmark alternates between (a) expecting full programs with imports and (b) postprocessing to strip imports and return only a single function, which is incompatible for functions that require numpy/scipy unless the harness injects them. The trace shows multiple such conflicting directives applied mid-run. | causation_reasoning: The run is marked failed despite the agent producing reasonable implementations for Schroed_deriv, SolveSchroedinger, Shoot, and FindBoundStates. The likely proximate cause is the benchmark's inconsistent harness postprocessing: the system tool forces removal of imports and returning only one function, which would make references like np.asarray or integrate.solve_ivp/ integrate.simpson/ optimize.brentq undefined unless the evaluation environment injects them. The agent cannot satisfy both 'do not include imports' and 'function must use np/integrate/optimize' unless the harness reliably provides those names, but the system postprocessor explicitly removes imports, demonstrating the scaffold itself can induce NameError at evaluation time. Thus the intrinsic misalignment plausibly caused the failure rather than an agent logic bug. | evidence: Contradictory instructions: ""Use only the following dependencies... Do not include these dependencies at the beginning of your code."" while also requiring numpy/scipy usage.
System postprocessing: ""You are a tool... returns only a python function. Remove any dependencies or imports... Your response should ONLY consist of one python function."" After this, the produced function contains ""return np.array([up, u_dd])  # np is assumed to be available in the execution environment"" showing dependence on stripped imports.
Agent repeatedly included imports to satisfy earlier instructions (e.g., ""import numpy as np"" and ""from scipy import integrate"" in SolveSchroedinger), but later the system forces removing them.

58,scicode,1.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The evaluation harness appears to require responses wrapped in an HTML-like <code>...</code> blob (it explicitly regex-searches for ""<code>(.*?)</code>""). However, the task's RESPONSE GUIDELINES instruct the agent to output a Markdown fenced block (```python ... ```). This is an intrinsic contradiction between the benchmark's specified output format and the grader/parser's required pattern, which can cause correct solutions to be rejected solely due to formatting. | causation_reasoning: The agent produced correct Python implementations multiple times (e.g., eos_eps_from_press, tov_RHS, tov). The run ultimately failed when the agent output plain prose/stray text (e.g., ""0.71</code>"") not wrapped in the required <code>...</code> pattern, triggering the parser error. Given the mismatch between the stated required format (```python) and the parser's regex requirement (<code>), this formatting deficiency directly led to failure even though the functional code existed earlier in the trace. | evidence: Parser error shows required pattern: ""Error in code parsing: Your code snippet is invalid, because the regex pattern <code>(.*?)</code> was not found in it."" and instructs: ""Make sure to include code with the correct pattern... <code> # Your python code here </code>"".

However, the task instructions to the agent require Markdown-style fenced code blocks (```python ...```), and earlier the system even instructs a different formatting transformation. This is an intrinsic mismatch between required output format and the harness's parser expectations, creating a structural trap where correct solutions can be rejected for formatting rather than correctness. | causation_reasoning: The agent produced correct Python implementations multiple times, but the run is marked failed due to repeated ""Error in code parsing"" messages complaining that the <code> regex pattern was not found.

This is not a property of the programming task itself, but of the harness' format assumptions, and it can impede any agent that follows the stated ""```python```"" response guideline rather than the hidden ""<code>"" requirement. | causation_reasoning: The agent's failures that terminate attempts are repeatedly triggered by the harness rejecting non-<code>-wrapped outputs (even when the agent is otherwise producing correct implementations).
