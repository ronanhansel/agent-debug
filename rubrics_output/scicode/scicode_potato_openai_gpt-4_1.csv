2,scicode,1.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The benchmark specifies a required dependency interface that is inconsistent with the actual execution environment. The prompt mandates `from scipy.integrate import simps` and even provides a shim to alias `scipy.integrate.simps` to `scipy.integrate.simpson` if missing. However, in the interpreter, importing `simps` fails because `scipy.integrate` lacks `simps` at import time, meaning the shim cannot run before the failing import. This makes the provided dependency instructions internally contradictory and non-executable as written. Additionally, the later system instruction requires returning only one python function with no imports, which conflicts with the earlier benchmark requirement to use numpy/scipy dependencies. | causation_reasoning: The agent's initial implementation failed directly due to the benchmark-specified import line (`from scipy.integrate import simps`), which raised an InterpreterError. This is a structural failure: any agent following the dependency block verbatim would hit the same import-time error before being able to apply the shim. The subsequent course-corrections avoided `simps` and used other SciPy components, but the original recorded failure was triggered by this intrinsic mismatch. The later failure mode (final output not being a single function matching the required signature) is downstream of the benchmark's conflicting formatting/harness constraints and the confusing toolchain messages, but the proximate failure in the trace is the broken dependency specification/import order. | evidence: Dependency block requires: `from scipy.integrate import simps` and then a shim: `if not hasattr(scipy.integrate, 'simps'):\n    scipy.integrate.simps = scipy.integrate.simpson`.
Runtime error: `Code execution failed at line 'from scipy.integrate import simps' due to: InterpreterError: Module scipy.integrate has no attribute simps`.
This shows the shim cannot execute because the import fails first. Later, a conflicting harness instruction appears: `returns only a python function... Please remove any dependencies or imports... Your response should ONLY consist of one python function`.",scicode_potato_openai_gpt-4_1
35,scicode,1.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The benchmark/evaluation harness appears to require answers to be wrapped in a specific markup (<code>...</code>) and/or to follow a strict output format, but this requirement is not consistently stated in the task instructions. The agent produced correct Python implementations multiple times, yet the system rejected one submission due to a regex parser looking for <code>(.*?)</code>. This indicates a scaffold/harness mismatch: the judging apparatus is parsing for a pattern that the prompt does not reliably enforce, making otherwise-correct solutions fail depending on formatting. | causation_reasoning: The failure is directly triggered by the harness/parser rejecting the agent's final_answer submission format, not by incorrect physics/math or Python logic. The agent’s earlier function implementation executed successfully in the python_interpreter and produced plausible outputs. The run is marked failed because the environment could not parse the agent’s code snippet (regex mismatch), which is an evaluation/scaffolding issue. If the harness accepted plain code blocks (as the prompt suggests) or did not require the <code> tag regex, the agent would have succeeded. | evidence: Parser error: ""Error in code parsing: Your code snippet is invalid, because the regex pattern <code>(.*?)</code> was not found in it."" The agent’s code itself ran: python_interpreter printed ""82484.15333534562"" for ground_state_wavelength test, and later generate_quadratic_combinations test output ""[ 6  9 12 14 15]"". The prompt told: ""Ensure your response is in the format of ```python```"", but the harness demanded a <code>...</code> capture, causing rejection.",scicode_potato_openai_gpt-4_1
28,scicode,1.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The benchmark environment appears to implement an incomplete subset of Python/numpy semantics that is not disclosed in the task. Specifically, normal numpy idioms used to meet the prompt (ABCD matrix composition via `@`, and safe floating-point handling via `np.errstate`) fail at runtime due to environment limitations. A well-formed benchmark would either support these standard operations or state they are unsupported and require alternatives. This hidden constraint is intrinsic to the evaluation environment, not the agent. | causation_reasoning: The agent's run failed when attempting to test/execute code using standard operations that the environment does not support. The agent encountered runtime errors unrelated to the optical logic itself: first `np.errstate` context manager failed, then matrix multiplication `@` failed. These are environment/tooling deficiencies that would impede any agent writing typical numpy/scipy code unless they guessed the hidden restrictions. Although the agent later worked around `@` by using `np.dot`, the failure events in the trace (and the run marked `failed: true`) were triggered by these intrinsic environment limitations. | evidence: 1) During testing `propagate_gaussian_beam`, execution failed at `with np.errstate(...)` usage: ""AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute '__exit__'"".
2) During testing `gaussian_beam_through_lens`, execution failed due to unsupported matrix multiplication: ""NotImplementedError: Binary operation MatMult is not implemented."".
3) These failures occurred even though the code followed standard numpy practices for Fourier optics and ABCD matrices.",scicode_potato_openai_gpt-4_1
52,scicode,1.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The benchmark/evaluation harness appears to require that submitted code be wrapped in a very specific markup/regex-detectable format (a `<code>...</code>` block), which is not part of standard Python execution and is not stated in the task's problem requirements. This is evidenced by a parsing failure complaining that a regex pattern `<code>(.*?)</code>` was not found, even though the Python function itself is valid. This indicates a misalignment between the task instructions (""Write the complete and executable Python program ... in ```python```"") and the evaluation apparatus, which expects a different wrapper/tagging format. | causation_reasoning: The run is marked failed due to a harness parsing error, not due to incorrect math/logic in the implemented `FindBoundStates`. The agent had already produced a reasonable implementation, but the system rejected it because it was not embedded in the expected `<code>...</code>` wrapper. Thus the intrinsic harness/template mismatch was the proximate cause of failure; fixing the parsing expectation (or documenting it) would likely allow success without changes to the algorithm. | evidence: Parsing failure: ""Error in code parsing: Your code snippet is invalid, because the regex pattern <code>(.*?)</code> was not found in it."" It then shows the rejected content beginning with `final_answer(\n""""""\nimport numpy as np ... def FindBoundStates...`. Task instruction mismatch: response guidelines demanded code in ```python```, but harness demanded `<code>...</code>`.",scicode_potato_openai_gpt-4_1
58,scicode,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The benchmark materials imply SciPy/NumPy availability via the listed dependencies (numpy, scipy, scipy.integrate) and the approach guidance explicitly suggests testing with the provided python interpreter. However, the provided python_interpreter tool description earlier in the run restricts imports to a small whitelist that does not include numpy/scipy. This is an environment-spec contradiction that can impede faithful adherence to the benchmark's stated dependency model in the planning/testing phase. | causation_reasoning: Despite the dependency/environment mismatch, the agent did not fail because of it. The agent successfully used scipy/numpy earlier in the run (solve_ivp, np.log/exp) indicating the execution environment for grading likely supports them, or at least the benchmark harness does. The actual recorded failure happened at the end when the agent returned an incomplete function with large sections commented out and explicit notes about removing numpy/scipy usage, which is an agent-side formatting/compliance mistake (it followed an unrelated system instruction to remove imports) rather than an intrinsic benchmark formation deficiency. | evidence: Environment mismatch evidence: python_interpreter tool says it ""can only import the following python libraries: ['unicodedata', 'stat', 'statistics', 're', 'random', 'queue', 'datetime', 'time', 'itertools', 'collections', 'math']"" while task dependencies specify ""import numpy as np\nimport scipy as sp\nimport scipy.integrate as si"". Actual failure evidence: final assistant output for tov contains commented-out integration code and notes: ""# np = # (remove imports and numpy code)\n# si = # (remove imports and scipy code) ... # return (star_mass, center_lapse)"" making the solution incomplete. Earlier the agent also triggered a parsing error by not wrapping final output in expected <code> tags: ""Error in code parsing: ... regex pattern <code>(.*?)</code> was not found"".",scicode_potato_openai_gpt-4_1
63,scicode,1.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The evaluation harness/code parser imposes a hidden formatting requirement: it searches the assistant message for a `<code>...</code>` block via the regex `<code>(.*?)</code>`. This is not aligned with the benchmark task's own RESPONSE GUIDELINES, which instruct the agent to return code in a markdown ```python``` block. This mismatch is an intrinsic benchmark formation deficiency because a correct solution can be rejected purely due to wrapper formatting rather than logic. | causation_reasoning: The run ultimately fails due to the parser rejecting the assistant's final answer formatting, independent of the algorithmic correctness of the implemented functions. The agent produced correct code multiple times, but when it tried to submit a final answer using `final_answer(...)` without being wrapped in `<code>...</code>`, the harness threw a parsing error and marked the run failed. This formatting trap is the proximate cause of the failure. | evidence: Hard failure from harness: ""Error in code parsing: Your code snippet is invalid, because the regex pattern <code>(.*?)</code> was not found in it."" It further instructs: ""It seems like you're trying to return the final answer, you can do it as follows: <code>\nfinal_answer(\""YOUR FINAL ANSWER HERE\"")\n</code>"". Meanwhile task RESPONSE GUIDELINES require markdown fences: ""Ensure your response is in the format of ```python```"". The agent's earlier `final_answer(...)` was rejected solely for missing the `<code>` wrapper: ""final_answer(...)</code>"" error message shows parser expectation, not code logic failure.",scicode_potato_openai_gpt-4_1
80,scicode,1.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The benchmark/harness appears to require answers to be wrapped in a literal ""<code>...</code>"" block (it parses with regex <code>(.*?)</code>). However, the task instructions repeatedly tell the agent to respond in markdown code fences (```python ... ```), and the system later says ""Respond ... in the format of ```python ```"". This conflicting formatting contract between prompt and evaluation parser is an intrinsic formation/scaffolding deficiency that can cause otherwise-correct solutions to be rejected before execution. | causation_reasoning: The agent produced correct implementations multiple times, but the run failed when attempting to finalize because the evaluation harness rejected the output format (regex not found), not because the algorithm/code was wrong. The terminal failure is a parsing error triggered by using final_answer(...) and/or markdown fences instead of the required <code> wrapper, which is a benchmark formatting mismatch. If the harness accepted the format the prompt asked for (```python```), the agent would likely have passed. | evidence: Repeated harness errors: ""Error in code parsing: Your code snippet is invalid, because the regex pattern <code>(.*?)</code> was not found in it."" (e.g., after final_answer calls at T0B31, T0B45, T0B65, T0B80, T0B88, T0B101, T0B103). Prompt formatting requirement: ""Ensure your response is in the format of ```python```.""

71,scicode,1.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The benchmark/evaluation harness imposes a rigid code-extraction regex requirement (expects code wrapped in literal <code>...</code>) that is inconsistent with the stated response format (```python``` blocks) and with the provided `final_answer` tool usage guidance. Multiple times, correct Python implementations were rejected due to the harness failing to find the regex pattern, indicating a structural scaffolding/parsing issue unrelated to solution correctness. Additionally, the provided python tool environment used for testing does not support the `@` (MatMult) operator and has a restricted import set, which is not clearly reconciled with the task instructions that rely on numpy/scipy; this further reflects implicit environmental assumptions that can block faithful execution/testing. | causation_reasoning: The agent produced correct implementations for multiple steps (e.g., `ket`, `tensor`, `generalized_amplitude_damping_channel`, `GADC_rev_coh_inf`) and even validated some via the interpreter, but the run was ultimately marked failed because the harness rejected the final submission format due to the missing `<code>(.*?)</code>` wrapper. The proximate failure messages explicitly cite regex عدم match rather than semantic/test failure.

12,scicode,1.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The run shows a systemic mismatch between the benchmark's expected interaction format and the evaluation harness' parser. The harness repeatedly rejects otherwise valid solution submissions because it expects responses to include a specific literal '<code>...</code>' wrapper (as indicated by the regex requirement), while the task instructions to the agent emphasize returning code in Markdown triple backticks. This is an intrinsic formation deficiency: the benchmark/evaluator enforces a hidden formatting constraint (regex for '<code>(.*?)</code>') that is not aligned with the prompt's stated response format, making correct solutions fail parsing. | causation_reasoning: The agent produced correct implementations multiple times, but the run is marked failed because final submissions were not accepted by the harness due to this formatting/regex parsing constraint. The failure was therefore proximately caused by the evaluator's parsing requirement, not by inability to implement the functions. Even when the agent attempted to call final_answer, the harness rejected it for lacking the '<code>...</code>' pattern. This indicates the agent's failure outcome is driven by the benchmark apparatus, not by algorithmic or coding errors. | evidence: Repeated harness errors: ""Error in code parsing: Your code snippet is invalid, because the regex pattern <code>(.*?)</code> was not found in it.""

Contradiction with stated response guidelines requiring Markdown: ""Ensure your response is in the format of ```python```"" while the harness demands '<code>...</code>'.
Agent had correct code before failures, e.g. implementations of f_Schrod, Numerov, shoot, calculate_HartreeU, etc. but parsing blocked acceptance.
