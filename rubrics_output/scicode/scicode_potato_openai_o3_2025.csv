2,scicode,1.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The benchmark specification requires SciPy via `from scipy.integrate import simps` (with a shim for deprecation/removal), but the execution environment used in the run does not provide SciPy/`simps` as importable.

Any agent that follows the dependency instructions (importing `simps` as specified) will hit an import/attribute failure in this environment. | causation_reasoning: The agent's first implementation failed at import time due to the environment lacking `scipy.integrate.simps`, which is exactly the dependency the benchmark told the agent to use. This prevented execution regardless of the correctness of the rest of the implementation. Although the agent later avoided SciPy, the recorded failure event in the run is directly attributable to the benchmark/environment dependency mismatch. | evidence: Failure message: ""Code execution failed at line 'from scipy.integrate import simps' due to: InterpreterError: Module scipy.integrate has no attribute simps"".

This is an intrinsic contradiction between the benchmark's stated formatting requirements and the parser used to validate submissions. | causation_reasoning: The agent produced valid Python implementations multiple times, but at least one of the grading attempts failed purely due to formatting: the system rejected a non-<code> wrapped response (and even rejected the stray ""0.78"" text) regardless of code correctness.

This creates a structural contradiction: a correct solution formatted per instructions can still be rejected by the harness unless it uses the separate <code> wrapper. This is an intrinsic benchmark formation deficiency because it is about incompatible formatting requirements between the problem spec and the evaluation/parser. | causation_reasoning: The agent ultimately produced correct implementations for the requested functions (notably absorption) and successfully executed a sanity check in the python interpreter. However, the run is marked failed due to the harness rejecting non-<code> formatted outputs when the agent output plain text scores or explanatory prose. The failure was thus triggered by the benchmark's parsing requirement rather than the algorithmic content. If the format requirement were aligned with the stated response guidelines (```python blocks), the agent would not have encountered the fatal parse error at the end. | evidence: Harness error: ""Error in code parsing: Your code snippet is invalid, because the regex pattern <code>(.*?)</code> was not found in it."" occurred when the agent output ""0.79</code>"" and later when it output prose: ""The `absorption` function is now fully implemented..."" followed by ""</code>"".

This is a structural issue in the evaluation apparatus: a well-implemented function can still be marked as failed if the final message is not wrapped in the harness’ expected tag format. The task prompt itself also inconsistently emphasizes Markdown triple backticks, while the harness later enforces a different regex/tag format, creating a mismatch between instructed format and what the grader actually parses. | causation_reasoning: The run failed due to the harness’s parsing regex mismatch, not due to inability to implement the required functions.
