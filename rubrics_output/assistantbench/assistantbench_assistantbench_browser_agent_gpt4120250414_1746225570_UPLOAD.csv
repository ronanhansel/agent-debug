The environment successfully accessed Google search results, indicating general website accessibility. There is no evidence of an impossible-to-access required site, a CAPTCHA block, or an incorrect/overly strict evaluation constraint shown here. | causation_reasoning: The failure occurred because the agent did not complete the information-gathering and calculation steps needed to produce the requested percentage.

The run shows the agent had web access (Google results loaded) and could have navigated to carrier rate calculators or authoritative pages to obtain an actual price quote. | causation_reasoning: Failure is due to agent capability/tool-use issues: the agent stopped at Google SERP snippets and inferred a $10 starting price from unrelated blog/snippet text, rather than retrieving an actual shipping quote for the specific origin/destination/item.

The task provides no definition of 'snow' (trace vs measurable) and no specified data source or method to compute the decade-specific probability, making the required computation underdetermined from available/linked content.

However, the core information is still feasibly retrievable: an agent could choose a reasonable operationalization (e.g., TripAdvisor forum posts by self-identified parents + TripAdvisor attraction pages meeting rating threshold) and produce an answer consistent with the prompt. | causation_reasoning: The run failed because the agent did not actually satisfy the stated quantitative TripAdvisor constraint (>=4.5 average AND >=50 reviews) for the hikes it listed, and also did not verify the “at least three different people with kids” requirement with concrete citations.
