It asks for the ""cheapest option to mail a DVD to Colombia from Hartford, Connecticut using FedEx, DHL, or USPS"" but does not specify required pricing determinants such as destination city/postal code in Colombia, shipment weight and package dimensions, service level constraints (express vs economy), declared value/insurance, pickup vs drop-off, delivery time requirement, and whether the shipper must be a consumer vs account holder. Without these, multiple different prices are valid depending on assumptions, so there is no unique correct answer. | causation_reasoning: Because the prompt omits critical shipment parameters, even a perfect agent cannot compute a uniquely correct ""cheapest option"" and price across FedEx/DHL/USPS. Any produced price would be contingent on arbitrary assumptions, and thus could not be reliably scored against a single gold answer.

This indicates the benchmark depends on a website that is not accessible in the automated browser environment, which is an intrinsic formation defect (bot detection/CAPTCHA blocking). | causation_reasoning: Because Zillow denied access to both the PEI sold search page and an individual property detail page, the agent could not reach the primary source needed to compute the smallest sold 2bd/2ba home in the specified time window. Google snippets alone do not contain the required combination of (a) confirmation of sold date within 2022-06-01 to 2024-05-15 and (b) square footage/beds/baths across all candidates to identify the minimum.

This indicates the information sources were reachable and that the task is, in principle, solvable by continuing to open the Tripadvisor pages and confirming (a) >=4.5 average with >=50 reviews and (b) at least three independent kid-family recommendations (e.g., forum posts/blogs/reviews from parents). | causation_reasoning: The failure stems from agent incompletion/strategy, not a benchmark defect. The agent did not proceed to open Tripadvisor attraction pages (despite having direct result links) and extract the rating/review totals and corroborating 'people with kids' recommendations from at least three different sources. The run ends mid-search without producing the required final list.

Since the task asks for the *closest* eatery to a specific location with a specific late-hour constraint, reliably determining the nearest open-at-11pm option typically requires map/distance tooling (e.g., Google Maps). The benchmark environment preventing access to Maps constitutes an intrinsic accessibility defect. | causation_reasoning: After being blocked from Google Maps, the agent attempted alternative sources (Google web results, Yelp), but Yelp rendered as an 'empty page' in this environment and the agent never obtained a distance-ranked list anchored to Harkness Memorial State Park. Without access to map results (or another distance-computing source working in-browser), no agent could deterministically compute 'closest' from the provided environment state, so the accessibility defect plausibly prevented completion. | evidence: Maps click led to CAPTCHA: ""Current url: https://www.google.com/sorry/index?..."" with ""reCAPTCHA"" and ""I'm not a robot"".

The agent encountered a transient 'chrome-error://chromewebdata/' when clicking a DHL result and later a 'Connection error.' after clicking 'CONTINUE' on FedEx.
