The failure is attributable to the benchmark's conflicting task setup: success criteria likely correspond to the later Yellowstone browser research task, which is unrelated to the initial QA prompt and was never executed in the shown assistant response segment.

The agent failed after encountering Zillow’s bot check and did not continue with other available search results (e.g., the Business Journals link it clicked, or other sources) to extract the 2021 Mission Bay high-rise sale high price.

In the run, the official California's Great America pages accessible to the agent only display 2025 pricing (season passes and daily tickets), not 2024 pricing.

Without archived 2024 pricing, the task is under-specified/unanswerable from the current site state. | causation_reasoning: The agent successfully retrieved a daily ticket price ('From $42') but it is explicitly for 2025, and the agent could not retrieve any 2024 season pass price from the season pass page (it only shows 2025 prices). Because the benchmark requires 2024-specific pricing to compute savings, and the current official pages do not provide those historical prices, the agent cannot complete the calculation.

For these carriers, available services are typically expressed as 1–3, 1–5, etc., business days, not “1 week” as a standard selectable option. This ambiguity creates multiple plausible interpretations of which service/price to report. | causation_reasoning: Despite the ambiguity, this defect did not make the task impossible.
