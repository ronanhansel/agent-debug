This is consistent with a site blocking automation or failing to render required content (e.g., bot detection / heavy JS that the environment cannot handle). Since the task requires identifying qualifying restaurants and verifying vegan mains under $15 within a 1-block radius, inability to access a major relevant source page constitutes a benchmark accessibility defect. | causation_reasoning: The agent reached Yelp from Google, but once on Yelp there were no elements to interact with and thus no way to continue extracting the necessary restaurant/menu/price information.

These are website accessibility issues (anti-bot/CAPTCHA) that prevent navigation/extraction in this benchmark browser environment. | causation_reasoning: The agent's failure is attributable to being blocked by anti-bot measures on the primary discovery mechanism (Google) and at least two likely target sources (Zillow and SF Chronicle).

This is a benchmark/environment accessibility issue because key information gathering via web search became unavailable. Additionally, direct navigation attempts to the museum site intermittently failed with browser-level load errors (chrome-error://chromewebdata/), indicating unreliable access in the environment. | causation_reasoning: The agent needed ticket and membership pricing to compute savings for 4 visits. After the initial page load, subsequent attempts to use Google were blocked by reCAPTCHA, and direct navigation to relevant museum pages failed with a chrome error. With search blocked and site navigation failing, the agent could not reliably retrieve required prices; thus the failure is attributable to access restrictions/timeouts rather than agent strategy. A stronger agent would still be unable to proceed past the reCAPTCHA without external solving capability and would be similarly impeded by repeated chrome-error load failures. | evidence: Google blocking: ""Current url: https://www.google.com/sorry/index?..."" and page text ""Our systems have detected unusual traffic..."" with ""reCAPTCHA"" and ""I'm not a robot"".

Google search became inaccessible due to a reCAPTCHA/""unusual traffic"" interstitial, and the target park website content relevant to 2024 pricing was not available on the accessible page (it only displayed 2025 pricing). These factors indicate the benchmark relies on dynamic, time-sensitive web content and sources (search + current park site) that are not stably accessible for automated agents. | causation_reasoning: To compute savings for summer 2024, the agent must obtain (a) 2024 daily ticket pricing for the relevant dates/months and (b) the 2024 season pass price. In the trace, Google was blocked by reCAPTCHA, preventing further search to locate 2024 archived pricing, and the park's season-pass page exposed only 2025 prices (no 2024 price present).

The browsing environment successfully accessed and navigated Google Maps and returned a filtered list of restaurants with Wednesday hours that include being open at/after 11pm, indicating the needed information is obtainable. | causation_reasoning: The failure is due to the agent not completing the remaining steps: determining which listed place is actually closest to Harkness Memorial State Park (e.g., by opening each candidate and comparing distance/travel time) and then returning the single final eatery name. The agent had actionable results (multiple eateries open at 11pm Wednesday) but stopped before extracting/confirming the closest one and producing the required final output.

These constitute intrinsic access barriers: the benchmark depends on resources that are not reliably reachable from the automated environment. | causation_reasoning: The agent’s failure is driven by inability to access necessary sources, not by navigation/extraction mistakes. The agent encountered (1) a 404 for the monday.com leadership page it tried to use to identify C-suite, (2) an SEC.gov automated access block when attempting to use EDGAR to identify IPO-time executives, and (3) a Google reCAPTCHA that prevents further search to locate alternate filings/sources.

Additionally, the fallback discovery method (Google) is blocked by a reCAPTCHA in this environment, eliminating a common alternative path to reach the needed Redfin sold-listings pages. This indicates an intrinsic accessibility issue with the benchmark's reliance on a specific Redfin URL structure that is not currently valid/accessible in the agent environment. | causation_reasoning: The agent failed because the pages needed to compute 'lowest sold price' were not accessible: the Queen Anne neighborhood page resolves to 'Page Not Found', and the attempt to use Google search to locate an alternate valid Redfin path was stopped by reCAPTCHA.
