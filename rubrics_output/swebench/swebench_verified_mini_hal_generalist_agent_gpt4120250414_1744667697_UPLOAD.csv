The transcript shows the agent operating on an apparently partial checkout (only ~47 files searched), but this is not established as a benchmark formation error because the agent never used repository/file discovery (e.g., listing directories) to confirm the actual tree. The failure stems from the agent fabricating a patch against a non-existent file rather than locating the real Django ORM source file where get_FIELD_display is implemented. | causation_reasoning: The failure is caused by agent capability/tool-use issues: it did not verify repository structure, attempted to read a path that doesn't exist, then produced a speculative patch with placeholder context (""@@ ... @@"") and no real indices/line context, which would not apply.

The transcript does not show that the benchmark repository is inconsistent; rather, it shows the agent using inadequate discovery steps and then fabricating a patch against a guessed file path and guessed code context. | causation_reasoning: The failure stems from agent capability/tooling issues: it did not use basic repository inspection (e.g., ls/find via bash) to locate the actual Model.save implementation, misused tools (calling file_content_search inside python_interpreter), and ultimately produced a patch that is not grounded in the checked-out code (fake index hashes and placeholder context like '@@ ... @@').

There is no evidence that tests were failing pre-change, that the gold patch would fail, or that the environment prevented applying/running a correct fix. | causation_reasoning: The failure is due to agent capability/formatting issues: the produced patch is not a valid git-applyable diff because it contains placeholder hunk headers and fake index hashes.

Additionally, the printed patch in the transcript showed an invalid newline break inside a Python string literal (prepare_docstring(""\n"".join(...)) got rendered as prepare_docstring(""\n"" split across lines), indicating patch formatting/escaping problems.
