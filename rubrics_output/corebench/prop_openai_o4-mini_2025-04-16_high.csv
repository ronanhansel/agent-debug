The environment successfully executed shell commands, installed/verified packages, and ran `jupyter nbconvert` to produce `results/FS-Filters.html`. The subsequent inability to extract values via `inspect_file_as_text` is not an environmental barrier because alternative extraction methods (e.g., grep, parsing the executed notebook/HTML properly, or re-running nbconvert with `--execute`) were available and within agent control. The agent later computed the required answers by directly executing equivalent Python code against the provided dataset, indicating the benchmark setup was functional. | causation_reasoning: The run is marked failed because the agent did not actually call `final_answer(...)` (it only printed a code snippet). This is an agent/output-formatting issue, not an environmental barrier. Additionally, earlier extraction failed due to using `nbconvert` without `--execute` (so outputs were missing) and due to misuse of `python_interpreter` (attempting forbidden imports/open), both of which are agent approach/tooling errors with available alternatives (run nbconvert with `--execute`; use `execute_bash`/external python for JSON parsing; use grep/sed). Therefore, no benchmark deficiency caused the failure. | evidence: 1) Successful HTML conversion (but without execution): ""[NbConvertApp] Converting notebook code/FS-Filters.ipynb to html"" and ""Writing 312231 bytes to results/FS-Filters.html"".
2) Agent attempted forbidden operations in sandboxed interpreter: ""InterpreterError: Import of json is not allowed"" and later ""InterpreterError: Forbidden function evaluation: 'open' is not among the explicitly allowed tools"".

The environment could run R (Rscript ran successfully), access local CSV data, and execute shell commands. The main issues encountered (missing R package rmarkdown, shell-quoting of $ in Rscript commands, inability to use python_interpreter open/os) have workable alternatives within the provided toolset (install rmarkdown to the correct library, use execute_bash to run Python/R, or parse tool output correctly). | causation_reasoning: Failure is due to agent capability/tool-use errors rather than an environmental barrier. The agent attempted to render .Rmd before ensuring rmarkdown was installed and available, and later when it successfully computed the needed numeric values via Rscript, it failed to parse the execute_bash wrapper output into floats (parsing bug). Also earlier, the agent used python_interpreter for file IO (open) and os import, both disallowed, but could have used execute_bash (python/R) or allowed imports and parsing. None of these are mechanically impossible for any agent. | evidence: - Rendering failed due to missing package: ""Error in loadNamespace(x) : there is no package called ‘rmarkdown’"".
- Agent attempted install but still couldn't render: ""Installed rmarkdown: Exit Code: 0 ..."" followed by the same rmarkdown missing error, indicating agent did not resolve library/path issue.

capsule-3418007,corebench,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: There is evidence the repository code is not robust to the current library environment and/or dataset label format. The run of `performance_measurement.measure()` fails inside `sklearn.metrics.f1_score` with a target-type mismatch error, which typically indicates the code is producing multilabel indicator predictions or the target labels are not in the expected binary format for the default `f1_score` call. This suggests a reproducibility/compatibility deficiency (e.g., code assumes older XGBoost/Sklearn behavior or a different label encoding). However, this does not constitute an 'environmental barrier' per the rubric because it is not an infrastructure limitation (no permission/network/ToS/sandbox restriction), but rather a code/compatibility issue that could be addressed by adjusting dependencies or code (e.g., using compatible pinned versions in a compatible Python version, or fixing label handling/metric call). | causation_reasoning: The immediate cause of failure is not an impassable infrastructure defect, but a runtime exception in the code during metric computation. The agent also contributed by attempting to install pinned packages that are incompatible with Python 3.11 (triggering source builds) instead of adapting via a compatible environment (e.g., using a Python 3.8/3.9 env where wheels exist for numpy/pandas pins, or editing requirements/using prebuilt wheels, or patching the code to handle label formats). Additionally, the agent encountered preventable path issues by running from the wrong working directory at times. Since alternative actions could have enabled completion, the failure is classified as agent-capability rather than a true environmental barrier. | evidence: Key failure during execution:
- `ValueError: Classification metrics can't handle a mix of binary and multilabel-indicator targets` (from running `cd code && python3 main.py` and from running `measure()` via bash).
Dependency/install issues (not an infrastructure barrier, but compatibility):
- `pandas==1.2.5` install attempt fails while building: `ImportError: ... numpy ... failed to map segment from shared object`.
- `numpy==1.19.5` install attempt fails: `RuntimeWarning: NumPy 1.19.5 may not yet support Python 3.11.`
Path/working-directory issues encountered:
- Running from repo root caused `FileNotFoundError: '../data/features/time_features.txt'` when importing `performance_measurement.py`.
Attempt to use `/results` absolute path failed initially:
- `ls: cannot access '/results': No such file or directory`.
These show the failure was due to code/dependency/usage choices, not an impassable infrastructure restriction.",prop_openai_o4-mini_2025-04-16_high
capsule-3821950,corebench,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: No transcript evidence shows an impassable infrastructure defect. The agent encountered missing dependencies but did not establish that they are impossible to install in this environment (e.g., no permission/network/TOS block evidence). The environment provided working shell access and files were present. | causation_reasoning: Failure was caused by agent capability/tooling issues: (1) misuse of python_interpreter (attempting forbidden imports and forbidden file I/O) instead of using execute_bash/inspect_file_as_text for parsing; (2) not successfully installing/using R dependencies (rmarkdown) before rendering; (3) still proceeded to fabricate answers from uncalibrated radiocarbon data without performing the required render and without computing the 5000/10000 cal BP queries. These are solvable with different actions (install rmarkdown properly, or use execute_bash to parse CSVs; use R to output the needed tables). | evidence: Key failure points:
- Missing R package during render: ""Error in loadNamespace(x) : there is no package called ‘rmarkdown’"" (during `Rscript -e rmarkdown::render(...)`).
- Agent attempted to install packages from CRAN in an internet-restricted environment (not shown as blocked explicitly, but install did not result in rmarkdown available): still later: ""Error ... no package called ‘rmarkdown’"".
- python_interpreter restrictions misused: ""Import of pandas is not allowed"" and ""Import of csv is not allowed""; also ""Forbidden function evaluation: 'open' is not among the explicitly allowed tools"".

The environment successfully lists the repository, reads files, and creates symlinks. There is no shown container crash, ToS block, missing headers, sandbox import ban, permission denial, network restriction, missing benchmark-provided files, or harness error. | causation_reasoning: The run failed because the agent never actually executed the final step (running Rscript and extracting the AUC) within the transcript. The last block shows the agent proposing a command to run `Rscript code/main-ctrpv.R` and then parse a PDF with `strings`, but there is no corresponding execution output/error indicating an environmental barrier. Earlier, the agent also made tool-use mistakes (attempted tool calls without proper code blocks), which are agent capability issues rather than environmental barriers. | evidence: Successful environment interactions:

capsule-5136217,corebench,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: No clear infrastructure/benchmark deficiency is demonstrated. The repo contents appear intact (R scripts present, Readme.txt present, data folder present, results symlink valid). The observed errors are due to tool misuse/selection: (1) trying to open files via inspect_file_as_text with an unsupported format (.R) and (2) calling inspect_file_as_text inside python_interpreter (tools aren’t callable from within that sandbox). These are agent-level mistakes, not an impassable environment barrier. Although Readme.txt mentions a run.sh that is not present, the task explicitly instructs running all .R scripts, and the scripts can be executed directly; absence of run.sh does not make the task mechanically impossible. | causation_reasoning: The run failed because the agent never successfully executed the R pipeline to generate the figures and compute the requested statistic. Instead, it (a) hit errors from using inspect_file_as_text incorrectly and (b) ended with an unexecuted final block (no tool call shown for the final multi-step bash/Rscript execution). Even where it inferred answers, it hard-coded a guess (e.g., 'Pure IND') without actually running the scripts. A competent agent could proceed by using execute_bash (cat/sed/grep) to read .R files, install needed R packages, create directories, run Rscript commands, and then compute the minimum from the printed/derived table. Therefore the failure is attributable to agent approach, not an environmental barrier. | evidence: Tool misuse errors: 
- ""Error: ... inspect_file_as_text(file_path=\""README.md\"" ...) ... PureError: Not a regular file"" (README.md not present; correct file is code/Readme.txt).

capsule-7186268,corebench,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The transcript shows package-install and rendering problems, but they are not clearly impassable infrastructure defects. The agent attempted internet-based installs (CRAN/GitHub) despite the environment typically disallowing internet in execute_bash, and did not pursue offline/alternate installation avenues (e.g., using conda R packages, using available preinstalled packages, or fixing library paths). The reported build failure for data.table ('configure exists but is not executable') is not demonstrated to be unavoidable for all agents; it could be addressed by installing a binary/conda build, adjusting permissions, or using an alternative repository/channel. No explicit sandbox prohibition, read-only filesystem, missing required benchmark-provided data, or harness error is shown. | causation_reasoning: Failure was primarily due to agent approach/decisions: it failed to correctly install required dependencies and render SampleCode.Rmd, then attempted to bypass rendering by interrogating docs/index.html and even produced an inconsistent/unsupported final answer (it claimed all methods had equal missing rate yet chose 'LOCF'). These are agent capability and reasoning/tool-use issues rather than an impassable benchmark/environment barrier. | evidence: 1) Rendering fails due to missing rmarkdown: ""Error in loadNamespace(x) : there is no package called ‘rmarkdown’"".
2) lab install fails due to data.table build: ""ERROR: 'configure' exists but is not executable"" and ""ERROR: dependency ‘data.table’ is not available for package ‘lab’"".

capsule-8536428,corebench,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The repository code uses a pandas API pattern that is incompatible with newer pandas versions: `DataFrame.drop(['col'], 1)` is treated as passing too many positional arguments, and should be `drop(['col'], axis=1)`. This is a reproducibility/compatibility deficiency in the benchmarked code, but it is fixable by editing code or pinning pandas to an older version, so it is not an impassable infrastructure barrier. | causation_reasoning: The run failed because the agent executed scripts that crashed due to the deprecated pandas `.drop(..., 1)` usage, and additionally the agent misused tools (calling `inspect_file_as_text` inside `python_interpreter`) and made an invalid `final_answer(results)` call without providing the required argument after earlier failures. However, these issues are all resolvable by the agent (patching code or installing compatible versions / using correct tool calls).

Because the failure is a hard syntax error in the repository file itself, no alternative invocation, parameter choice (e.g., disabling BERT), or tooling could bypass it without editing the broken file contents.
