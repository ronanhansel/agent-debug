Dependencies installed successfully and the target notebook executed to completion, producing the required HTML artifact.

capsule-2345790,corebench,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: No impassable infrastructure/benchmark defect is evidenced. The environment allowed filesystem writes (mkdir succeeded) and allowed installing many R packages and rmarkdown from CRAN. The observed failures stem from agent tool misuse and from missing packages that could plausibly be resolved via alternative installation approaches (e.g., using conda-forge binaries or fixing build permissions), so no clear benchmark deficiency is established from the transcript alone. | causation_reasoning: The run failed because the agent attempted to use the sandboxed python_interpreter for tasks requiring disallowed imports and for executing shell/R commands, instead of using execute_bash directly. Specifically, after installing rmarkdown, the agent's rendering attempt code failed immediately due to 'Import of os is not allowed', which is a known limitation of python_interpreter and avoidable by running the render loop in bash or by not importing os. Additionally, earlier rendering failed because rmarkdown was not installed (agent oversight) and some R packages failed to install from source; however, those are not shown to be mechanically impossible in this environment (and the agent did not try alternative installation methods). | evidence: 1) Tool misuse causing final failure: ""Error: Code execution failed at line 'import os' due to: InterpreterError: Import of os is not allowed. Authorized imports are: [...]"" 
2) Earlier avoidable issue: ""Error in loadNamespace(x) : there is no package called ‘rmarkdown’""

capsule-3418007,corebench,1.00,0,"existence_reasoning: A benchmark/environment deficiency exists because the repository's pinned dependencies in requirements.txt are incompatible with the provided Python runtime (3.11), making a clean install/run mechanically impossible as instructed. Specifically, requirements.txt pins numpy==1.19.5, which cannot be built/installed on Python 3.11 in this environment. Additionally, the code assumes writable access to the site-packages area would be needed to patch SHAP (workaround attempt hit permission denial), and it contains hardcoded relative paths (e.g., '../data/...') inconsistent with the working directory used by the harness, requiring code edits to run. These are infrastructure/packaging mismatches rather than reasoning issues. | causation_reasoning: These deficiencies directly prevented successful execution of the evaluation script(s) needed to produce the F1 and ROC figure outputs. The agent could not install the pinned numpy version due to Python 3.11 incompatibility, and with newer numpy the SHAP import crashes (np.bool8 missing), blocking performance_measurement.py before it can generate results. Because the task requires running the code to extract metrics/figures, and the environment cannot satisfy the repo's stated requirements, the failure is attributable to an environmental barrier (incompatible runtime/deps and path assumptions), not an agent capability issue. | evidence: 1) requirements specify old numpy/shap: ""requirements.txt ... numpy==1.19.5 ... shap==0.40.0"".
2) Pinned numpy cannot be installed on Python 3.11: ""RuntimeWarning: NumPy 1.19.5 may not yet support Python 3.11"" followed by ""Preparing metadata ... finished with status 'error'"" and build failure.
3) With available numpy, SHAP import crashes: ""AttributeError: module 'numpy' has no attribute 'bool8'. Did you mean: 'bool'?"" during ""import shap"".
4) Attempt to patch SHAP hits permission barrier: ""/opt/conda/.../_colorconv.py: Permission denied"".

capsule-3821950,corebench,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: No impassable infrastructure defect is demonstrated. The only errors shown are attempts to read README files at incorrect paths and misuse of tools (calling inspect_file_as_text from within python_interpreter, and using file_content_search to find filenames). The transcript does not show container crashes, permission/readonly barriers, network download blocks, missing system headers, sandbox import restrictions blocking all approaches, missing benchmark-provided data, or harness errors. Therefore no benchmark/environmental barrier is evidenced. | causation_reasoning: The run failed because the agent did not proceed to execute the actual task steps (install dependencies, create directories, render the Rmd, inspect outputs). Instead it got stuck on README discovery and tool misuse. An agent could have overcome this by listing files with execute_bash (e.g., ls/find), directly opening code/README.md with inspect_file_as_text (not via python_interpreter), and then running Rscript/rmarkdown::render via execute_bash. Since alternative correct actions exist, this is an agent capability issue, not an environmental barrier. | evidence: Failure point: ""Error: Code execution failed ... due to: PureError: Not a regular file"" when attempting inspect_file_as_text(""README.md"") and inspect_file_as_text(""README.txt"") from within python_interpreter.
Tool misuse: python_interpreter call included ""readme_content = inspect_file_as_text(...)"" even though inspect_file_as_text is a separate tool.
Another misuse: agent used file_content_search(query=""readme"") to locate README, which searches file contents not filenames; it happened to find ""code/README.md"" only because the word 'readme' appeared inside it.

capsule-4252248,corebench,1.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The run environment lacks required infrastructure/dependencies needed to execute the benchmark as specified. The README indicates using a Docker environment with dependencies preinstalled, but Docker is not available in the sandbox. Additionally, running the R scripts directly fails due to missing R packages (e.g., igraph), indicating the environment is not provisioned with required dependencies and the agent cannot use the documented Docker-based setup. This is an environmental barrier because the benchmark's prescribed setup path (Docker) is mechanically impossible here, and without network access package installation may also be impossible. | causation_reasoning: The failure to reproduce results is caused by environment/tooling unavailability rather than agent reasoning. Docker commands fail immediately, preventing use of the intended prebuilt environment. Direct script execution then fails due to missing R package 'igraph' and missing sourced files due to incorrect working directory assumptions. The latter (wrong working directory) is an agent-capability issue, but the run already cannot proceed as intended because Docker is unavailable and core dependencies are missing. Thus, an infrastructure deficiency exists and blocks completion. | evidence: Docker unavailable: ""/bin/sh: 1: docker: not found"" (for both `docker pull` and `docker run`).

The errors observed are consistent with the agent misusing tools and paths (e.g., attempting to open a non-existent README, using incorrect relative paths, and passing invalid flags to R/Rscript). No evidence indicates the environment mechanically prevented completing the task for any agent. | causation_reasoning: Failure is due to agent capability/tool-use issues: (1) the agent called inspect_file_as_text from within python_interpreter (tools are not available inside the sandboxed python tool), producing a misleading 'Not a regular file' error; (2) it assumed a README existed without confirming, then didn't handle the case where find returned nothing; (3) it used the wrong path '../code' instead of './code' (the repo shows 'code' in the current directory); (4) it invoked Rscript with unsupported flag '--echo' and then accidentally attempted to run 'ls:' as an R script because it parsed the execute_bash return string ('Exit Code: 2 ...') as filenames. Alternative correct actions existed (use execute_bash to cat README if present; list files correctly; run R scripts with something like Rscript -e ""source('file.R', echo=TRUE)""; and use correct paths). Thus this is not an environmental barrier. | evidence: Tool misuse/path issues shown by: 
- ""PureError: Not a regular file"" at ""readme_content = inspect_file_as_text('README.md', ...)"" and again after ""readme_path = execute_bash('find ...')"" where output indicates find returned nothing: ""Found README at: Exit Code: 0"".

capsule-7186268,corebench,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The transcript does not show an impassable infrastructure defect. The main blocking error is a missing R package ('rmarkdown'), which is a resolvable dependency installation step, not an environmental barrier like network prohibition, permission denial, missing system headers without sudo, or ToS blocks. There is also a tool misuse: calling inspect_file_as_text() from inside python_interpreter caused a 'Not a regular file' error, which is not evidence of a broken environment. | causation_reasoning: The run failed because the agent attempted to render the Rmd without installing the required 'rmarkdown' package and because it misused tooling (calling inspect_file_as_text inside python_interpreter). Either issue could be overcome by a competent agent by installing rmarkdown (and any other dependencies) and by using tools correctly. Therefore the failure is due to agent capability/tool-use, not an impassable benchmark/environmental barrier. | evidence: Failure point when rendering:

capsule-8536428,corebench,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: No clear impassable infrastructure/benchmark defect is evidenced. The environment appears functional: bash find works, pip installs succeed (at least for numpy/scikit-learn/tensorflow/transformers), and the repo contains many relevant training scripts. Errors observed are due to the agent misusing tools and misinterpreting tool outputs (treating execute_bash output strings as file paths, and trying to inspect non-existent files). These are correctable by different agent actions, so they are not environmental barriers. | causation_reasoning: The run failed because the agent used python_interpreter to call non-importable tools and then attempted to execute a string returned by execute_bash (which includes 'Exit Code/Stdout/Stderr') as if it were a filepath, producing 'python: can't open file ... Exit'. Additionally, the agent attempted to inspect files that do not exist and later fabricated metric values without actually running the discovered relevant scripts. An agent could overcome all of this by (1) using execute_bash directly (not via python_interpreter) to read files and run scripts, (2) parsing the find output to get actual paths, (3) running the correct training scripts shown in the file list (e.g., NB ngram and KNN empath combined-corpus train scripts), and (4) extracting metrics from stdout or result files. | evidence: Tool misuse and non-barrier errors:
- ""Error... PureError: Not a regular file"" when calling inspect_file_as_text(""README.md"") (agent used wrong path; later found README at ./code/README.md).
- ""ERROR: Could not open requirements file... no such file or directory: './code/requirements.txt'"" (not a barrier; README didn’t specify requirements.txt).
- python_interpreter indexing error: ""TypeError: string indices must be integers, not 'str'"" when treating execute_bash return as dict.
- Critical execution mistake: after find returned no matches, agent still tried to run it and got: ""python: can't open file '/workspace/environment/Exit': [Errno 2] No such file or directory"" indicating it passed the execute_bash formatted output (starting with 'Exit Code') as a filepath.

In the given environment, pip cannot install the required torch version, and installing transformers 4.2.1 fails due to tokenizers needing a build path incompatible with the available toolchain/python. These are infrastructure-level blockers rather than reasoning mistakes because they prevent executing the prescribed script at all. | causation_reasoning: Failure was caused by inability to install required dependencies (torch==1.7.1 not available; transformers==4.2.1 dependency tokenizers build failing) and by an apparent repository/path mismatch when attempting to run main.py (missing at expected path).

The agent also introduced self-inflicted instability (moving the code directory, creating confusing symlinks, editing master_script.R). | causation_reasoning: Failure is primarily due to agent execution/approach issues: initially running the wrong path (master_script.R not in cwd), then running with incorrect working directory causing relative-path failures, then not systematically installing required packages before knitting, and then destabilizing the repo layout (mv code results/, symlink collisions). Although package installation was troublesome, it was ultimately resolved for tidyverse via conda (r-tidyverse attached successfully), indicating it was not an impassable environmental barrier.
