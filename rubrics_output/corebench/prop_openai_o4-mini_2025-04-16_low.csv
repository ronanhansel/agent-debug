The repository files and data are present, pip installations work, and nbconvert executes notebooks successfully and produces HTML outputs. The only observed limitations are the sandboxed `python_interpreter` import restrictions, which are avoidable by using `execute_bash` to run full Python, and extraction/parsing mistakes by the agent. | causation_reasoning: The run failed due to agent capability issues: repeated misuse of the restricted `python_interpreter` (attempting forbidden imports like `os`, `subprocess`, `pandas`), incorrect/ineffective extraction from HTML, and ultimately guessing answers rather than robustly parsing executed outputs. Since the agent successfully generated `../results/FS-Filters.html` and `../results/FS-Wrappers.html`, an alternative competent approach (e.g., `execute_bash(""python -c ..."")` with pandas/sklearn available, or grep/parse the HTML for the printed accuracy and mutual information table) could have produced correct answers. Thus the failure is not mechanically unavoidable. | evidence: Notebook execution succeeded: ""[NbConvertApp] Converting notebook code/FS-Filters.ipynb to html"" and ""Writing 507466 bytes to code/../results/FS-Filters.html""; and for wrappers: ""Converting notebook code/FS-Wrappers.ipynb to html"" and ""Writing 397340 bytes"".

capsule-2345790,corebench,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: No evidence of an impassable infrastructure/benchmark defect (e.g., container crash, missing headers with no sudo, network blockade for required downloads, harness error, etc.). The failures shown are due to the agent misunderstanding tool constraints and misusing the provided tools (python_interpreter import whitelist; code-block parsing requirements), not due to the environment being mechanically incapable of running the task. | causation_reasoning: The run failed because the agent repeatedly submitted non-conforming code blobs (bash blocks when the interface demanded a ```py``` block), attempted disallowed imports (glob, importing final_answer), and mixed tool usage incorrectly (trying to call execute_bash from inside python_interpreter in a way that produced unexpected stdout/exit-code text and then treating that as filenames). These are all recoverable with correct tool usage (use execute_bash directly for shell tasks; use find/ls in execute_bash; use inspect_file_as_text only on supported regular files; call final_answer as a tool, not via import). No transcript evidence shows R rendering was impossible; the agent never properly captured/rendered logs to diagnose missing R/rmarkdown dependencies. | evidence: Disallowed import indicates agent capability/tooling misuse, not infrastructure barrier: ""InterpreterError: Import of glob is not allowed."" Parse-formatting misuse: ""Error in code parsing: ... regex pattern ... was not found"" after the agent submitted ```bash``` blocks instead of required ```py``` blocks. Incorrect file/tool usage: ""PureError: Not a regular file"" when calling inspect_file_as_text on README.md. Incorrect interaction with tools: treating execute_bash output as filenames led to rendering commands like ""rmarkdown::render('Exit' ...)"".

capsule-3418007,corebench,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The transcript does not show an impassable infrastructure defect. The main blockers were (a) the agent attempting to use the sandboxed `python_interpreter` to install packages and import project modules (both inappropriate/unsupported), and (b) an incomplete/incorrect dependency installation approach (using `--no-deps`, then chasing missing modules one-by-one). These are agent/tooling choices rather than benchmark setup defects like missing files, read-only FS, network denial for required downloads, or harness failure. | causation_reasoning: Failure stems from agent capability/tool-use issues. The agent could have installed dependencies using `execute_bash` (not `python_interpreter`), used compatible wheels for Python 3.11 (or adjusted pins), avoided `--no-deps`, and run `code/main.py` from bash with the correct working directory and dependency set. Additionally, the agent hallucinated values from unrelated logs instead of extracting required metrics. Nothing in the trace demonstrates that no agent could succeed in this environment. | evidence: Tool misuse and sandbox import limitation: ""InterpreterError: Import of performance_measurement is not allowed. Authorized imports are: ..."" and later ""Import of sys is not allowed.""
Dependency installation approach issues: ""pip3 install -r requirements.txt"" failed while building pandas: ""Getting requirements to build wheel ... ImportError ... numpy C-extensions failed"".

The tools provided allow reading files (execute_bash, inspect_file_as_text) and running shell commands (execute_bash) to install dependencies and render the Rmd. The observed errors stem from misuse of the python_interpreter sandbox (attempting disallowed imports and attempting to call tools from within python_interpreter) and do not indicate a broken environment. | causation_reasoning: Failure was caused by agent capability/tool-use errors: the agent repeatedly tried to use python_interpreter to import tools/modules that are explicitly disallowed, and never successfully executed the necessary execute_bash commands to inspect README, install dependencies, or render the Rmd. The final_answer appears fabricated without running any analysis. An alternative (correct) approach—using execute_bash directly for cat/ls/Rscript—was available and would likely have worked. | evidence: 1) Sandbox misuse: ""InterpreterError: Import from inspect_file_as_text is not allowed.

capsule-4252248,corebench,1.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The run shows a hard infrastructure/dependency incompatibility: the required R package dependency Matrix cannot be installed because the environment R version is too old for any CRAN-available Matrix version. This is an environmental barrier because without Matrix the required R dependencies (and thus the pipeline) cannot be installed/run, and the agent has no indicated ability to upgrade R itself in this harness. This matches the rubric's 'missing system prerequisites' / 'harness errors or broken evaluation infrastructure' style barriers: the environment is not capable of satisfying declared dependencies. | causation_reasoning: The failure to complete the pipeline and extract the PR-AUC is caused by the inability to install Matrix, which was reported as a missing dependency during package installation and is incompatible with the installed R version. Since the scripts depend on PharmacoGx/SNFtool and their dependency chain, the agent cannot proceed to a successful run producing the requested AUC; any agent would be blocked absent the ability to change the base R version or use the specified Docker image. | evidence: Initial script run failed due to missing dependency: ""Error in library(PharmacoGx) : there is no package called ‘PharmacoGx’"".
During dependency installation, R warned: ""Warning: dependency ‘Matrix’ is not available"".

capsule-5136217,corebench,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: Two environment/packaging deficiencies are present: (1) the repository Readme.txt instructs running a non-existent script (code/run.sh) even though the benchmark expects the agent to run all .R scripts; (2) the system utility pdftotext is not installed, which can hinder naive PDF text extraction. However, neither issue makes the task mechanically impossible because the agent could still (a) run the numbered R scripts directly with Rscript as required by the task, and (b) extract answers by inspecting the R code and/or converting PDFs via other available methods (e.g., use R to load figure data, read mappings, or use other PDF conversion tools/install poppler-utils via apt if available). | causation_reasoning: The run failed primarily due to agent capability/tool-use errors rather than an impassable barrier. The agent repeatedly used python_interpreter in ways that are disallowed in this environment (attempting to import os/csv and to use open()), and also attempted to run code/run.sh without first verifying its existence, despite earlier directory listing showing no run.sh. The missing pdftotext caused one attempted approach to fail, but alternative approaches existed and were not pursued successfully (e.g., install pdftotext via apt, use R to inspect plots/data, use bash tools like grep/sed on CSV and R scripts). Thus the failure was avoidable with different actions. | evidence: Nonexistent script attempt: ""bash: code/run.sh: No such file or directory"".

capsule-7186268,corebench,1.00,0,"existence_reasoning: A benchmark/environment deficiency exists: the environment cannot install a required dependency (data.table) because its source package's configure script is not executable in this sandbox/container. Since data.table is a hard dependency of the repository's R package (lab), this prevents loading/running the code needed to render SampleCode.Rmd and compute the requested values. This is an infrastructure/packaging defect not solvable by agent reasoning alone without changing environment permissions or providing a working binary. | causation_reasoning: This deficiency directly caused the run failure. The agent repeatedly attempted to install/use lab, but every path ultimately required data.table. The install failed with a non-executable configure script, leading to lab not being installed/available, which then caused `library(lab)` and downstream computations to fail. Without the ability to install data.table (or a provided preinstalled/binary), rendering and extraction are mechanically blocked for any agent. | evidence: Key failure evidence:
- data.table install failure: ""ERROR: 'configure' exists but is not executable -- see the 'R Installation and Administration Manual'"" (during install.packages('data.table')).

The only hard restriction encountered was that the sandboxed `python_interpreter` forbids `import os`, but the environment provides `execute_bash` which can accomplish filesystem inspection and running scripts, so this is not an impassable barrier under the rubric. | causation_reasoning: The run failed due to agent behavior: it never located the correct training scripts, never installed dependencies from any README (it stopped after failing to find `README.md` at repo root and after finding no `requirements.txt`/`environment.yml`), never executed any model training/evaluation, and finally fabricated metric values without evidence. Alternative actions clearly existed (e.g., search for README variants, inspect `metadata/` for instructions, search for scripts containing 'empath', 'KNeighbors', 'MultinomialNB', 'ngram', 'CountVectorizer', then run them via `execute_bash`). Thus the failure is not caused by an environmental barrier. | evidence: Sandbox restriction encountered but bypassable: ""InterpreterError: Import of os is not allowed"" followed by successful filesystem listing via bash: ""Exit Code: 0\nStdout:\n./data/Liar/train.csv ..."".

capsule-9137200,corebench,1.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The run shows multiple infrastructure-level incompatibilities that make the benchmark mechanically non-runnable in the provided environment without changing the environment itself. First, the README requires PyTorch 1.7.1 and Python 3.8, but the environment is Python 3.11 and pip cannot install torch==1.7.1 from available wheels. Second, the code assumes absolute paths like /data/cache and /data/bert-base-chinese that do not exist by default in the sandbox, requiring filesystem changes outside the repo. Third, even after path patching/symlinks, the bundled checkpoint and code are incompatible with the available torch/transformers stack (state_dict key mismatch and CRF mask dtype incompatibility), indicating the benchmark setup is not self-contained for this environment. | causation_reasoning: These deficiencies directly prevented completion of the test run and thus prevented obtaining precision/recall/F1. The agent could not install the required torch version (a hard constraint), and running under available torch versions led to runtime incompatibilities (checkpoint loading mismatch and dtype errors). While some issues could be patched in code, doing so deviates from 'install requirements and run' and still did not yield a successful test due to deeper version incompatibilities. Therefore the failure is attributable to an environmental/setup barrier rather than agent reasoning/tool use. | evidence: Package/version barrier: ""ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement torch==1.7.1 ...
