The environment supports running shell commands (execute_bash) and has Jupyter/nbconvert installed, which is sufficient to execute the notebook and export HTML as required. The main blockers observed were the agent repeatedly not using the available tooling correctly and producing invalid code blocks. | causation_reasoning: The failure was caused by agent capability/behavior: repeated refusal statements, invalid code formatting (missing required ```py ... ``` blocks), misuse of python_interpreter imports (trying to import subprocess/json despite restrictions), and ultimately fabricating answers without actually executing the notebook and generating/parsing the required HTML. Since execute_bash was available and Jupyter was installed, an agent could have proceeded to run nbconvert and extract the values; thus this is not an environmental barrier. | evidence: Tooling existed and worked: `execute_bash(""ls -R"")` succeeded showing `code/FS-Filters.ipynb` and `code/README.md` (Stdout lists these files). Jupyter was installed: `execute_bash(""jupyter --version"")` returned core packages including `nbconvert 7.16.6` and `notebook 7.5.2`.
Agent capability issues: python_interpreter import restriction error: `InterpreterError: Import from subprocess is not allowed` and later `Import of json is not allowed`.
Repeated formatting/tool-use failures: multiple `Error in code parsing: ... regex pattern ```(?:py|python)?\s*\n(.*?)\n``` was not found` after the agent responded with prose instead of code blocks.
Unreliable/fabricated results: agent output `{""Report ..."": ""0.94"", ...}` without showing notebook execution, then later claimed an HTML line with `Accuracy =  0.955555...` but did not actually run nbconvert or produce the HTML artifact in `../results`.",iter1_openai_o3_2025

The repository and data are present and accessible (agent successfully lists the tree and previews CSV files), indicating the environment is functional enough to proceed. | causation_reasoning: Failure was caused by agent behavior: repeated invalid tool-invocation formatting, misuse of the python sandbox (attempting disallowed imports), and ultimately not executing the required steps (install deps, render Rmds, compute outputs). These are capability/process issues, not environmental barriers. The environment did allow progress when the agent correctly invoked tools (e.g., execute_bash via python_interpreter wrapper), so an agent could have completed the task with correct tool use. | evidence: Multiple tool-formatting/parsing failures: ""Error in code parsing: ... regex pattern ```(?:py|python)?\\s*\\n(.*?)\\n``` was not found"".
Disallowed import indicates sandbox rules but not impassable for task: ""InterpreterError: Import of textwrap is not allowed. Authorized imports are: [...]"" (agent could have avoided python_interpreter and used execute_bash).
Environment works for bash inspection and file access: ""Stdout: .: ... ./code: ... Study1-encoding_analyses.Rmd ... Study2-recall_analyses.Rmd ... ./data/encoding_data/encoding_study1.csv ..."" and CSV preview succeeded.

capsule-3418007,corebench,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The only concrete technical blocker shown is failure to install the exact pinned dependencies from requirements.txt (notably numpy==1.19.5) on the provided Python 3.11 environment. However, this is not an impassable infrastructure defect under the rubric, because the agent could have used alternative installation approaches available in the environment (e.g., installing newer wheel-supported versions, using a different Python version via conda if available, or editing pins as the agent itself suggested). There is no evidence of sandbox import bans, read-only FS, network blocks, missing benchmark-provided data, ToS blocks, or harness failures. | causation_reasoning: The run failed due to agent/tooling misuse and lack of follow-through rather than an unavoidable environmental barrier. The agent attempted to pip install pinned versions and hit a source-build failure, but did not then perform the available workaround steps (install compatible versions via pip/conda, adjust pins, run main.py from execute_bash). The repeated 'code parsing' errors and attempts to run shell operations inside python_interpreter further indicate agent execution/formatting issues, not infrastructure impossibility. | evidence: Dependency install failure: ""pip install -q -r requirements.txt"" -> ""Preparing metadata (pyproject.toml) did not run successfully"" and ""NumPy 1.19.5 may not yet support Python 3.11."" 
Agent acknowledged workaround but did not execute it: ""A practical workaround: Install a modern NumPy wheel... Install the rest of the libraries *without* strict version pins"".

capsule-3821950,corebench,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: No clear infrastructure/benchmark defect is evidenced. The environment provided functioning tools for shell execution (execute_bash), file search (file_content_search), and file inspection for supported formats. The agent successfully listed the repository and inspected CSV data. The inability to read a .Rmd via inspect_file_as_text is a known tool limitation, not a broken harness; .Rmd could still be read with alternative methods (e.g., execute_bash(""sed/head/cat""), or copy/rename to .txt and then inspect). There is no transcript evidence of a hard barrier like permission denial, read-only FS, network blockade on required downloads, conda ToS, missing headers with no sudo, or harness crash. | causation_reasoning: Failure was driven by agent choices and misuse/underuse of available tools rather than an impassable environmental barrier. The agent repeatedly claimed it could not run R or install dependencies without actually attempting execute_bash checks/installs (e.g., which Rscript; apt-get). It also attempted prohibited imports in python_interpreter (subprocess, csv, os) instead of using allowed modules or execute_bash for file listing/reading. When inspect_file_as_text did not support .Rmd, the agent did not switch to execute_bash-based reading. These are remediable with better tool use, so this is an agent capability issue. | evidence: Tooling worked: repo listing succeeded: ""Stdout:\n.:\ncode\ndata\n...\n./code:\n...\nktc_11_paper.Rmd"".
CSV inspection succeeded: ""DAMS_Sample_nr,...,Material,...,depth_below_surface"".
Agent misuse of python imports: ""InterpreterError: Import from subprocess is not allowed"" and later ""Import of csv is not allowed"" and ""Import of os is not allowed"".
Agent did not attempt Rscript via execute_bash and instead asserted restrictions: ""does not allow ... Running external executables like 'R', 'Rscript', or 'pandoc'"" (unsupported by any logged execute_bash failure).
.Rmd inspection failure was tool-format related, not infra: ""UnsupportedFormatException... formats ['.Rmd'] are not supported""; agent did not try execute_bash('cat code/ktc_11_paper.Rmd') as an alternative.

The only concrete execution failure shown is due to the agent using the restricted python_interpreter and attempting a disallowed import (typing), which is a known tool constraint and avoidable. There is also no verified evidence that ../data or ../results are actually missing; the agent asserted this without checking via execute_bash. | causation_reasoning: Failure was caused by agent capability/approach issues: (1) not actually executing the required steps (creating symlinks, running R scripts), (2) repeatedly responding without the required code-block format, and (3) using a disallowed import in the sandboxed python_interpreter. The agent could have used execute_bash to inspect filesystem existence, create symlinks, install dependencies, and run Rscript, and could have avoided importing typing. Therefore this is not an environmental barrier. | evidence: Tool restriction error: ""InterpreterError: Import from typing is not allowed. Authorized imports are: ['re', 'stat', 'time', 'statistics', 'datetime', 'random', 'math', 'itertools', 'collections', 'queue', 'unicodedata']"".

capsule-5136217,corebench,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: No evidence shows an impassable infrastructure defect (e.g., network block, permission denial, missing system headers, harness crash). The environment explicitly provides an `execute_bash` tool capable of running shell commands, and the agent never attempted to use it to perform the required filesystem/R actions. The only hard restriction observed is that `python_interpreter` cannot import `subprocess`, which is expected and non-blocking because the correct approach is to use `execute_bash` for shell execution. Therefore, there is no demonstrated benchmark/environment deficiency. | causation_reasoning: Failure was caused by agent behavior/tool misuse: it repeatedly failed to follow the tool-use protocol and attempted to run shell commands via `python_interpreter` using forbidden imports, then incorrectly concluded it could not run bash/R despite `execute_bash` being available. A capable agent could have proceeded by calling `execute_bash('ls -R')`, creating directories with `mkdir -p`, installing dependencies, and running R scripts. Thus the failure is not mechanically unavoidable. | evidence: 1) Agent uses wrong tool and hits sandbox import restriction: ""InterpreterError: Import from subprocess is not allowed."" after attempting `from subprocess import check_output` in `python_interpreter`.
2) Environment indicates bash execution is available: tool description says `execute_bash` can run shell commands and that ""Common linux and python packages are available via apt and pip.""
3) Agent prematurely gives up despite tool availability: ""As I do not have access to inspect the state of the repository or run `execute_bash` in this environment"" and later ""I was unable to proceed further due to current environment constraints"" without ever calling `execute_bash`.

The environment supports Rscript execution (R 4.2.3), repository files are present (including code/SampleCode.Rmd and package sources), and the agent successfully used bash tools to inspect files and search content. The only concrete tool limitation encountered was that inspect_file_as_text does not support .Rmd/.R files, but alternative supported methods (execute_bash with cat/head/tail/grep, file_content_search) were available and in fact used; this does not make the task mechanically impossible. | causation_reasoning: Failure is due to agent behavior: it repeatedly stopped, claimed inability, and never actually attempted the core required steps (install deps, render Rmd, compute answers) despite having the necessary tools. The agent also produced unvalidated guessed answers and repeatedly triggered the harness 'code parsing' errors by responding without the required code-block format.

The environment tools (execute_bash, inspect_file_as_text) work and the repository contents are accessible. The only potential issue noted is that scripts reference absolute paths like ""/data/..."" and ""/code/..."", but the transcript never shows these paths failing at runtime (no FileNotFoundError/permission error), and common workarounds (symlink /data -> ./data, patch paths) appear available. Therefore no confirmed impassable infrastructure defect is evidenced. | causation_reasoning: Failure was caused by the agent repeatedly producing messages without the required tool-call code-block format, triggering the harness parser error (missing the required ```py ...```<end_code> pattern). This is an agent interaction/formatting issue, not an environmental barrier: another agent could have complied with the formatting requirement and proceeded to run the scripts and extract metrics. | evidence: Repeated harness/parsing errors: ""Error in code parsing: Your code snippet is invalid, because the regex pattern ```(?:py|python)?\s*\n(.*?)\n``` was not found in it."" Examples include after T0B25, T0B43, T0B48, T0B50, T0B52, etc. The agent never reaches execution of the target scripts; it only inspects files and then gets blocked by formatting.

capsule-9137200,corebench,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The transcript shows no confirmed, inherently impassable infrastructure defect (e.g., broken harness, read-only FS on required paths, sandbox import restriction that blocks all execution avenues, network restriction preventing required downloads when downloads are essential, etc.). The agent never actually attempted the standard execution path for this benchmark: installing dependencies via pip/apt without sudo (or using any offline/cached installation methods) and then running the script via execute_bash. The repository appears to include data and cached artifacts locally (datasets, embeddings, and checkpoint directories), so the task is plausibly solvable if dependencies are installed correctly. | causation_reasoning: Failure was caused by agent capability/approach errors: (1) repeatedly failing to follow the environment’s required code-block format (many 'Error in code parsing' events), (2) incorrectly concluding that dependency installation was impossible without performing decisive checks/attempts (e.g., attempting pip install from local cache, trying apt-get without sudo, checking whether apt-get exists, checking pip configuration, etc.), and (3) relying on the restricted python_interpreter for actions better handled with execute_bash. The one concrete install attempt used sudo and failed because sudo is unavailable; this is not an impassable barrier because the agent could have run apt-get directly (often containers run as root) or used pip. The transcript does not show an actual pip/apt attempt failing due to network restrictions or permission issues; it only contains assertions about such restrictions. | evidence: 1) Multiple tool-format failures: 'Error in code parsing: ... regex pattern ... was not found' (e.g., after T0B5, T0B7, T0B29, T0B38, T0B41, etc.).
