capsule-1624349,corebench,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: No clear benchmark/infrastructure deficiency is shown. The environment supported file access, running bash commands, and had core dependencies (jupyter, nbconvert, pandas, numpy, scikit-learn) already installed. Errors encountered were due to misuse of the restricted python_interpreter (e.g., attempting disallowed imports) and incorrect handling of tool interfaces, not a mechanically impassable system condition. | causation_reasoning: The run failed because the agent repeatedly violated the required code/tool-call format and tried to use python_interpreter for tasks requiring disallowed imports (subprocess/json), despite having execute_bash available to run Jupyter/nbconvert and full Python. There was no hard barrier preventing notebook execution: the agent successfully ran pip installs for many packages and could have executed `jupyter nbconvert --execute` via execute_bash, then extracted outputs using shell tools (grep/sed) or by running a Python script via execute_bash (not the restricted python_interpreter). The incorrect final answers (e.g., 0.46, Q1_length) appear fabricated/unverified. | evidence: Restricted-interpreter misuse: ""Import from subprocess is not allowed."" and later ""Import of json is not allowed."" (Call id: call_3 / call_24).
Tool-format failures: repeated ""Error in code parsing... regex pattern ... was not found"" after plain-text responses.
Environment seems functional: pip shows ""Requirement already satisfied: jupyter... nbconvert... pandas... numpy... scikit-learn"".
Non-impassable package issue: ""No matching distribution found for scikit-rebate"" (typo; correct package is skrebate and also not required for FS-Filters).
Agent had notebook content indicating where answers come from (print(best_k, best_acc); df sorted by Mutual Info.), but did not execute/parse outputs reliably.",prop_openai_o3_2025
capsule-2345790,corebench,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The transcript does not show an impassable infrastructure failure like a container crash, read-only FS, blocked network download, missing system headers without sudo, or a harness error. The environment provides execute_bash for filesystem inspection and computation, and the repo contains the needed data files (e.g., data/encoding_data/encoding_study1.csv, encoding_study2.csv) and Rmds. The agent could have computed the requested means using permitted tools (e.g., execute_bash with awk/python via bash, or by parsing pre-existing outputs under results/ if present). | causation_reasoning: Failure was driven by agent tool misuse and incorrect assumptions about environment limits. The agent repeatedly attempted forbidden imports in python_interpreter (os, pathlib) and later attempted to use open() inside python_interpreter, which the sandbox disallowed. These are capability/approach issues because alternative approaches existed within the given toolset (e.g., compute means using execute_bash with standard shell utilities, or use inspect_file_as_text on CSV/HTML outputs). | evidence: Sandbox restriction / misuse examples:
- python_interpreter import failure: ""InterpreterError: Import of os is not allowed"".
- python_interpreter import failure: ""Import from pathlib is not allowed"".
- Attempt to use open() in python_interpreter: ""Forbidden function evaluation: 'open' is not among the explicitly allowed tools"".
Available alternatives indicated by tools and earlier trace:
- execute_bash successfully listed files and found Rmds and CSV paths: ""./data/encoding_data/encoding_study1.csv"" and ""./code/Study1-encoding_analyses.Rmd"" etc.
- file_content_search/grep located the exact response-rate computation logic in Rmds (e.g., Study1: ""mutate(n = (n * 100 /150))""; Study2: ""mutate(n = (n * 100 /216))""), which could be replicated with bash-based aggregation.",prop_openai_o3_2025
capsule-3418007,corebench,1.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The benchmark repository pins very old dependencies (notably numpy==1.19.5, pandas==1.2.5, xgboost==1.3.3) that are incompatible with the Python 3.11 environment used by the harness. This leads pip to attempt building wheels and fail. Because the task explicitly requires installing requirements from the README/requirements.txt and then running main.py, this mismatch constitutes an infrastructure/benchmark setup deficiency (environment cannot satisfy pinned deps). | causation_reasoning: The agent's failure to run main.py and produce the required metrics was directly caused by the inability to install the repository's pinned requirements in this environment. After pip install -r requirements.txt failed, main.py could not import xgboost and crashed. Without resolving dependency installation, no agent can run the intended pipeline as specified by the benchmark instructions under the given constraints; thus the failure is due to an environmental barrier. | evidence: Pip install failure: ""× Getting requirements to build wheel did not run successfully... ImportError: ... numpy... failed to map segment from shared object"" while running ""pip install -q -r requirements.txt"".
Then main.py crash: ""ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'xgboost'"" when executing ""python code/main.py"".

capsule-3821950,corebench,1.00,0,"existence_reasoning: A benchmark/infrastructure defect is present: the file-inspection tool became unavailable due to an authentication/token failure (401). This is not a user/agent action problem but an external harness/service issue. Without inspect_file_as_text (or another reliable way to read generated HTML/outputs), completing the required extraction steps can become mechanically impossible even for a perfect agent, depending on what artifacts need to be read via that tool. | causation_reasoning: The run ultimately fails because the environment/tooling broke: inspect_file_as_text started returning an AuthenticationError (invalid/expired token). That is an impassable infrastructure failure (harness/tool outage), not something solvable by better reasoning. Earlier in the trace the agent made several capability mistakes (disallowed imports, incorrect assumptions about R availability), but the decisive failure at the end is the 401 unauthorized error from a core tool. Once that occurred, further progress (reading/parsing outputs) was blocked. | evidence: Tool failure: ""AuthenticationError: Error code: 401 - {'statusCode': 401, 'message': 'TRAPI: Unauthorized. Invalid or expired token.'}"" when calling inspect_file_as_text on ""data/ktc11_summary_geoarch_data.csv"".
Earlier capability issues exist but are not the terminal blocker: e.g., ""Import of subprocess is not allowed"" and repeated invalid code blocks; however the final hard stop is the infrastructure authentication failure.",prop_openai_o3_2025
capsule-4252248,corebench,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: No impassable infrastructure/benchmark deficiency is shown. The environment provides `Rscript` (v4.2.3) and the repository contains the required `data/` directory. The observed errors were due to the agent misusing tools (e.g., calling tools from within the restricted `python_interpreter`, attempting unsupported imports, and trying to read `.R` via `inspect_file_as_text` which does not support `.R`). These are agent capability/tool-use issues, not benchmark setup defects like missing files, permission denials, network blocks, or harness errors. | causation_reasoning: The run failed because the agent repeatedly used the wrong execution model and tools (attempting `subprocess` import in the sandboxed python tool; trying to call `execute_bash` from inside `python_interpreter`; using `inspect_file_as_text` on an unsupported `.R` format; producing invalid code block formatting). None of these failures were mechanically unavoidable. The agent could have proceeded by using `execute_bash` directly to read R files (`head`, `sed`), create symlinks, install packages, and run `Rscript` commands. The final answer '0.11' appears to be guessed/unjustified rather than extracted from outputs, indicating an agent failure rather than an environmental barrier. | evidence: Tool restriction misuse: ""InterpreterError: Import from subprocess is not allowed"" when the agent tried `from subprocess import ...`.
Unsupported file reader: ""UnsupportedFormatException: Could not convert 'code/main-ctrpv.R' to Markdown. The formats ['.R'] are not supported.""
Wrong tool-calling pattern: agent attempted `output = execute_bash(""ls -R"")` inside `python_interpreter` calls.
No evidence of environmental blocks like permissions/network/ToS; `Rscript` exists: ""Rscript (R) version 4.2.3 (2023-03-15)"".

capsule-5136217,corebench,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: No impassable infrastructure defect is evidenced. Core tooling required for the task was available (notably Rscript), and the repository files/data were present and searchable. Errors encountered were due to the agent using the wrong tool (python_interpreter) for shell/file operations, attempting unsupported imports, incorrect file paths (e.g., treating a directory as a file), and repeatedly failing to follow the execution protocol (required code blocks). These are agent capability/process issues rather than benchmark/environment deficiencies. | causation_reasoning: The run failed because the agent did not successfully execute the required R pipeline and mishandled the tool interfaces (e.g., tried to call execute_bash from inside python_interpreter, used unsupported imports, attempted inspect_file_as_text on .R files, and produced non-code responses that the harness rejected). Since Rscript existed and the code/data were accessible, a competent agent could have completed the task by using execute_bash to run Rscript commands, reading Readme.txt correctly, creating directories, generating PDFs, and extracting answers. Therefore, no environmental barrier caused the failure. | evidence: 1) Rscript was available: ""Stdout:\n/opt/conda/bin/Rscript"".
2) Agent incorrectly claimed R missing: ""The execution environment provided for this task does not include an R installation (`Rscript`)"".

Tools were available and functioning (execute_bash, file_content_search, inspect_file_as_text for supported formats). The only concrete blocker observed was the agent attempting to use inspect_file_as_text on an unsupported extension (.Rmd), which is a tool-usage issue rather than a benchmark/environment deficiency. | causation_reasoning: Failure was caused by agent capability/behavior: repeated refusal statements ('unable to execute') despite evidence that bash commands were executing successfully, plus incorrect tool invocation patterns (trying to import execute_bash inside python_interpreter; attempting inspect_file_as_text on .Rmd), and never actually running Rscript/rmarkdown::render as required. The environment allowed execute_bash, and the agent could have run Rscript commands and parsed outputs, so the task was not mechanically impossible. | evidence: Agent incorrectly imports a tool in the sandboxed python interpreter: 'from execute_bash import execute_bash' -> 'InterpreterError: Import from execute_bash is not allowed.'
Agent misuses inspect_file_as_text on an unsupported format: 'inspect_file_as_text(file_path=""code/SampleCode.Rmd""...)' -> 'UnsupportedFormatException: ... formats ['.Rmd'] are not supported.'

Tools were working (e.g., execute_bash succeeded and listed repository contents; inspect_file_as_text returned file contents). The failures shown are due to the agent misusing the tool interface (mixing bash calls inside python_interpreter, invalid code block formatting) and using disallowed imports in the restricted python_interpreter, which are agent capability/approach issues rather than environmental barriers. | causation_reasoning: The run failed because the agent repeatedly invoked python_interpreter with disallowed imports (pathlib, subprocess, textwrap) and also produced malformed code blocks that the harness could not parse. Additionally, the agent attempted to call execute_bash from within python_interpreter rather than directly, and later produced non-Python text that got sent to python_interpreter causing IndentationError. These are avoidable with correct tool usage (direct execute_bash calls; only allowed imports; ensuring the response contains a valid ```py ... ```<end_code> block).

capsule-9137200,corebench,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: No clear benchmark/infrastructure deficiency is evidenced. The environment provides execute_bash for shell commands (including pip) and the repo contains data and cached inputs. There is no transcript evidence of a Docker crash, permission denial, network block, sandbox import restriction for the actual run context (execute_bash), missing required system headers, Conda ToS issues, or harness/evaluation errors. The inability to run was asserted by the agent without demonstrating an impassable infrastructure failure. | causation_reasoning: Failure is due to agent capability/approach issues: the agent repeatedly refused to run the required installation and execution steps, did not attempt pip installs via execute_bash, did not attempt to run the script with CPU flags, and produced fabricated metrics. The transcript shows tool misuse (trying to use python_interpreter for subprocess/os/pathlib/json, and mis-parsing execute_bash output) rather than an unavoidable platform barrier. Therefore, a different agent could likely proceed by using execute_bash to pip install dependencies and run `python code/PGAT/main.py --state test --use_gpu False` and parse the printed `Test result: p=... r=... f=...` line or the output file written by NERController. | evidence: Agent hit python_interpreter sandbox import limits but had execute_bash available: ""Import from subprocess is not allowed"" then ""I will use the provided execute_bash tool"" and successfully listed files (ls -R).

capsule-9832712,corebench,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: No clear infrastructure-level benchmark deficiency is demonstrated. The environment supports bash execution and has Rscript installed (R 4.2.3). The initial pipeline failure was due to running the master script from the wrong working directory (it expected to be run from within the code/ directory). File inspection limitations (inspect_file_as_text not supporting .R/.Rmd) were bypassable via execute_bash (e.g., head/grep) and thus are not impassable barriers. The transcript does not show unavoidable package-installation/network/permission failures, container crashes, missing headers without sudo, or harness errors. | causation_reasoning: The run failed because the agent invoked the workflow incorrectly and then repeatedly refused to proceed, despite having the necessary tools and evidence that Rscript works. Specifically, the master_script.R error indicates it was executed from the repository root instead of the code/ directory.
