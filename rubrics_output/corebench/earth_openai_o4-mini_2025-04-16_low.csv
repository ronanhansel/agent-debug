The key errors shown are (a) a formatting/parsing issue with how the agent wrote a tool call (using a ```bash``` block instead of the required ```py``` pattern), which is an agent/tool-usage mistake rather than an environment crash or missing system dependency [T0B6:<RANGE>Error:
Error in code parsing:
Your code snippet is invalid, because the regex pattern ```(?:py|python)?\s*\n(.*?)\n``` was not found in it.</RANGE>], and (b) an unsupported file-reading pathway for README.md via a specific tool, which the agent successfully worked around by using `cat` through the shell, indicating the environment remained functional [T0B12:<RANGE>UnsupportedFormatException: Could not convert 'README.md' to Markdown. The formats ['.md', '.md'] are not supported.</RANGE>] [T0B13]. No evidence appears of Docker/container crashes, broken shells, or missing system-level dependencies blocking execution; shell commands run successfully and return expected output (e.g., directory listing and file contents) [T0B9] [T0B21].",earth_openai_o4-mini_2025-04-16_low
capsule-9054015,environmental_barrier,0.00,0,"The failures shown are due to missing R packages required by the repository code, not an infrastructure-level breakdown that makes the task mechanically unrunnable. When running the scripts, execution halts with standard R errors stating that packages are not installed (""there is no package called ‘here’"" and ""there is no package called ‘viridis’""); this indicates unmet software dependencies rather than a crashed container, broken shell, or harness failure.

capsule-9240688,environmental_barrier,0.00,0,"The run shows issues caused by the agent’s tool misuse and incorrect assumptions, not an impassable infrastructure failure. The agent attempted to read README.md using the Python interpreter by calling a harness tool inside it, which failed with a file error (""PureError: Not a regular file"") rather than a system crash or missing dependency in the environment [T0B7:<RANGE>Code execution failed at line 'readme = inspect_file_as_text(file_path=""README.md"", question=""Please output the full content of README.md so I can see installation and execution instructions."")' due to: PureError: Not a regular file</RANGE>]. The agent then ran `cat README.md` and got ""No such file or directory"" because the README was located elsewhere, indicating a path/assumption mistake rather than a broken filesystem or sandbox failure [T0B10:<RANGE>cat: README.md: No such file or directory</RANGE>]. Later, it mis-specified the filename case (`07-figure-3.r` vs `07-figure-3.R`) and `head` failed accordingly, again an agent error, not an environmental barrier [T0B28:<RANGE>head: cannot open 'code/07-figure-3.r' for reading: No such file or directory</RANGE>]. The environment itself remained functional: directory listing worked and files could be read via bash [T0B13:<RANGE>Stdout:

 Exit Code: 0</RANGE>]. Although the overall task mentions the missing `run.sh`, the transcript does not show an infrastructure-level blocker (e.g., crashed container, missing system dependency that prevents execution); instead, it shows the agent proceeding with alternative methods and encountering user-level command/path/tooling mistakes.",earth_openai_o4-mini_2025-04-16_low
capsule-9832712,environmental_barrier,0.00,0,"Environmental barrier behavior is absent because the run’s blocking issues were primarily due to the agent’s own tool misuse and workflow mistakes rather than an impassable infrastructure failure. First, the agent repeatedly failed to use tools correctly (e.g., submitting “Thought:” without a required code block pattern) which caused parsing failures unrelated to the environment. [T0B6:<RANGE>Error in code parsing:
Your code snippet is invalid, because the regex pattern ```(?:py|python)?\s*\n(.*?)\n``` was not found in it.</RANGE>]

Second, the agent attempted unsupported operations in the restricted python tool (e.g., using `open()` and importing `csv`, both disallowed by the tool sandbox), which again are agent/tool-usage errors, not infrastructure defects. [T0B12:<RANGE>InterpreterError: Forbidden function evaluation: 'open' is not among the explicitly allowed tools or defined/imported in the preceding code</RANGE>] [T0B97:<RANGE>Import of csv is not allowed. Authorized imports are: ['unicodedata', 'math', 'itertools', 're', 'datetime', 'statistics', 'stat', 'collections', 'time', 'random', 'queue']</RANGE>]

While there was an external ToS gate encountered during conda installs, it was not an impassable barrier because the agent successfully worked around it by removing defaults and using `--override-channels -c conda-forge`, and conda then proceeded to solve and download packages. [T0B34:<RANGE>CondaToSNonInteractiveError: Terms of Service have not been accepted for the following channels</RANGE>] [T0B37]

Finally, the R pipeline failure was due to missing project files/paths (e.g., `01_scopus-selection/01_sampling.R` not found) rather than broken infrastructure. [T0B37:<RANGE>cannot open file '01_scopus-selection/01_sampling.R': No such file or directory</RANGE>]

Overall, the environment remained functional (shell commands executed, conda installs succeeded with proper configuration, and Rscript existed), and the remaining blockers stemmed from agent mistakes and repository/path issues rather than a mechanically unrunnable evaluation harness.",earth_openai_o4-mini_2025-04-16_low

The only explicit error is a formatting/parsing issue caused by the agent using an invalid code-block pattern (bash block instead of the required python pattern), which is an agent/tool-usage mistake rather than an environment barrier [T0B6:<RANGE>Error in code parsing:
Your code snippet is invalid, because the regex pattern ```(?:py|python)?\s*\n(.*?)\n``` was not found in it.</RANGE>]. After correcting the code-block format, the shell tooling works normally: directory listing and file reads succeed (e.g., recursive ls, sed/grep) [T0B12] [T0B26] [T0B31].
