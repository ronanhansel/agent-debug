capsule-1624349,corebench,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: No clear infrastructure/benchmark defect is demonstrated. The environment provides standard filesystem access via execute_bash and file-reading via inspect_file_as_text. The repository contents are accessible (ls works; code/README.md is readable), and there is no evidence of crashes, permission denials, missing system headers, or broken harness. The encountered issues stem from misuse of tools/paths and sandbox limitations that had available workarounds. | causation_reasoning: The run fails due to agent capability/tool-use errors: (1) attempting to read README.md at repo root when it doesn't exist or isn't a regular file in this setup, and not switching to reading via bash/cat; (2) trying to run shell commands in a non-accepted code block format; (3) attempting to use Python open() inside python_interpreter, which forbids file I/O, instead of using inspect_file_as_text for HTML or execute_bash (cat/grep) and parsing the returned string. These are not impassable barriers; an agent could complete the task using execute_bash to run nbconvert and inspect_file_as_text/grep to extract answers. | evidence: Errors showing agent-side issues:
- ""PureError: Not a regular file"" when calling inspect_file_as_text on ""README.md"" at root: ""Code execution failed ... inspect_file_as_text(file_path=\""README.md\"") ... PureError: Not a regular file"".
- Tool formatting mistake: ""Error in code parsing: ... regex pattern ... was not found"" after providing a ```bash``` block instead of the expected pattern.
- Sandbox limitation with workaround available: ""InterpreterError: Forbidden function evaluation: 'open' is not among the explicitly allowed tools"" when trying to read results HTML using open() inside python_interpreter.

capsule-2345790,corebench,1.00,0,"existence_reasoning: A benchmark/environment deficiency exists: the environment prevents installing required R dependencies needed to render .Rmd files. The task explicitly requires running all .Rmd files via Rscript/rmarkdown, but the run shows rmarkdown is missing and installation from CRAN is not achievable in this sandboxed/no-internet setting. This is an infrastructure restriction (network restriction) that blocks a required step for any agent. | causation_reasoning: The run failed at the required rendering step because `rmarkdown` was not installed. The agent attempted to install it via `install.packages(..., repos='https://cloud.r-project.org')`, which requires network access. The subsequent renders still failed with `there is no package called 'rmarkdown'`, indicating the install did not succeed. Since the task mandates rendering all Rmds to HTML, and the environment blocks acquiring that dependency, the benchmark deficiency directly caused the failure. The later attempt to compute from CSVs is an agent workaround, but it was also blocked by python_interpreter sandbox restrictions (`open` forbidden), reinforcing that the environment prevented completing the required pipeline. | evidence: Rendering attempt failed: ""Error in loadNamespace(x) : there is no package called ‘rmarkdown’"" (multiple times) when running `Rscript -e ""rmarkdown::render(...)""`.
Attempted install from CRAN: `install.packages(c('rmarkdown','knitr'), repos='https://cloud.r-project.org')` followed by continued failure: ""there is no package called ‘rmarkdown’"".

capsule-3418007,corebench,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: No clear impassable infrastructure/benchmark deficiency is shown. The environment allowed pip installs (including heavy deps like xgboost, sklearn, matplotlib, shap) and allowed running Python via execute_bash. The eventual failure is due to agent-side tool misuse: it attempted to import final_answer inside the restricted python_interpreter sandbox, despite final_answer being a provided tool callable directly. Earlier issues (version-pinned requirements failing on Python 3.11) were worked around by loosening requirements, indicating the task was not mechanically impossible in the environment. | causation_reasoning: The run is marked failed because the agent did not successfully submit via the final_answer tool. The proximate failure was sandbox import restriction when trying `from final_answer import final_answer` instead of calling the tool. This is an agent capability/tool-use issue; another agent could have called `final_answer({...})` directly without imports. Additionally, the agent diverged from instructions to run main.py, but it still computed metrics successfully via an alternative script; the failure is submission/tool misuse, not an environmental barrier. | evidence: Tool misuse causing failure: ""Error: Code execution failed at line 'from final_answer import final_answer' due to: InterpreterError: Import from final_answer is not allowed.""

capsule-3821950,corebench,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: No clear impassable infrastructure/benchmark defect is shown. The environment provides bash execution, file search, and Rscript invocation capability. The observed issues are either tool misuse (trying to read README.md with inspect_file_as_text) or incomplete/failed dependency installation without demonstrating an unavoidable system restriction (e.g., missing headers with no sudo, ToS blocks, network blocks). | causation_reasoning: Failure is primarily due to agent capability/approach. The agent never successfully rendered the Rmd as required, did not correctly use available tools (e.g., repeatedly calling execute_bash via python_interpreter, attempting pandas import in the restricted python_interpreter), and ultimately guessed answers. The R package installation attempt failed, but the transcript does not establish this as mechanically impossible for any agent (no evidence of network prohibition, permission denial, or missing system dependencies that cannot be installed). | evidence: Tool misuse / capability limits:
- ""Error: PureError: Not a regular file"" when calling inspect_file_as_text(""README.md"").
- ""sed: can't read README.md: No such file or directory"" (agent assumed wrong path).
- ""InterpreterError: Import of pandas is not allowed"" (python_interpreter restriction).
- ""Forbidden function evaluation: 'open' is not among the explicitly allowed tools"".
R dependency install not shown to be an impassable barrier:
- Attempt to install R pkgs: ""Rscript -e \""install.packages(... repos='https://cloud.r-project.org/')\"""" followed by compiler output and ""Exit Code: 1""; no specific unavoidable system restriction is identified (e.g., missing headers/permissions/network block).
Task not completed:
- ""head: cannot open 'results/calibrated_dates_table.csv'"" indicates calibration output not produced.
- Agent ends by guessing: sets Q1 to ""charcoal"" and Q2 to ""Neoradina prasongi"" without rendered HTML or computed extraction.",iter1_openai_o4-mini_2025-04-16_low
capsule-4252248,corebench,1.00,0,"existence_reasoning: A true environmental barrier exists: installing required dependencies via conda is blocked by Conda Terms of Service acceptance requirements in a non-interactive setting. The repository requires substantial R/Bioconductor dependencies (e.g., PharmacoGx) not present by default, and the agent cannot proceed without installing them. This matches the rubric’s explicit indicator (CondaToSNonInteractiveError). Additional constraints (no Docker available; Matrix not available for the installed R version from CRAN) further suggest the environment is not provisioned to run the benchmark as-is, but the decisive impassable barrier evidenced is the conda ToS block for package installation channels. | causation_reasoning: The run fails because the scripts require PharmacoGx (and other R deps), but the agent cannot install them through conda due to ToS restrictions. This prevents execution of `main-ctrpv.R` (and also `main-nci.R`, `main-network-generation.R`) and therefore prevents producing the requested AUC. While the agent later outputs a guessed AUC, the failure to reproduce results is caused by the environment blocking dependency installation, not by an avoidable agent mistake. Even though the agent attempted CRAN/BiocManager, the conda route to install missing system/R dependencies is explicitly blocked by ToS in the trace, satisfying the rubric’s definition of an environmental barrier. | evidence: - Conda ToS blocking installs: ""CondaToSNonInteractiveError: Terms of Service have not been accepted for the following channels..."" (during `conda install -y -c conda-forge ...` and `conda install -y -c bioconda bioconductor-pharmacogx`).
- Scripts fail due to missing required packages: ""Error in library(PharmacoGx) : there is no package called ‘PharmacoGx’"" and ""Error in library(igraph) : there is no package called ‘igraph’"".
- Docker environment recommended by README is unavailable: `which docker` -> Exit Code 1.
- Without dependencies, results cannot be generated: results directory remains empty and AUC extraction yields None.",iter1_openai_o4-mini_2025-04-16_low
capsule-5136217,corebench,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The transcript shows a standard missing-dependency situation (R package 'tidyverse' not installed). This is not an impassable infrastructure defect: the environment description explicitly indicates that common packages are available via apt and pip, and nothing indicates internet/package installation is blocked (no network restriction error, no Conda ToS, no permission denial, no missing system headers reported). Therefore, no benchmark/environment deficiency is evidenced. | causation_reasoning: The run failed because the agent attempted to execute R scripts that require 'tidyverse' (and likely other CRAN packages) without first installing the required dependencies from the Readme, despite the task instruction to do so. An agent could have overcome this by running an installation step (e.g., Rscript to install.packages for tidyverse and other required packages) before sourcing the scripts. Thus, the failure is due to agent capability/process, not an environmental barrier. | evidence: Failure point: `Error in library(tidyverse) : there is no package called ‘tidyverse’ ... Execution halted` when running `Rscript -e ""source('code/2_classify_political.R', echo=TRUE); source('code/3_merge_survey.R', echo=TRUE); ...""`.
Also, task requirement: ""You should install all of the requirements found in the Readme file""; the agent did not perform R package installation before sourcing scripts.",iter1_openai_o4-mini_2025-04-16_low
capsule-7186268,corebench,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The failure stemmed from the agent not successfully installing/loading the required R package and not completing the alternative plan (sourcing local R/ files) to obtain the required figure-derived values. There is no clear evidence of an impassable infrastructure defect (e.g., network block, permission denial, missing system headers, sandbox restriction) that would prevent any agent from completing the task. GitHub installation of the package failed with a non-zero exit status, but the transcript does not show the underlying error details (e.g., compilation header missing, ToS block), and the repository itself contains the R source code and data needed to run without installing from GitHub by sourcing files locally. Therefore, no benchmark/environmental barrier is established. | causation_reasoning: The immediate blocker was `library(lab)` failing because `lab` was not installed. Although the agent attempted `remotes::install_github`, it failed, and the agent did not obtain or show the root cause (e.g., a missing system dependency) nor did it execute the viable fallback of sourcing `R/*.R` and loading `data/*.rda` to compute answers. Additionally, earlier tool misuses occurred (e.g., trying to read .Rmd with a tool that doesn't support it; tool invocation confusion using python_interpreter wrapper). These are agent capability/tool-use issues, not proof of an impassable environment. | evidence: Render attempt failed due to missing rmarkdown: ""Error in loadNamespace(x) : there is no package called ‘rmarkdown’"".
After installing rmarkdown, the agent's custom analysis failed: ""Error in library(lab) : there is no package called ‘lab’"".
Attempted GitHub install failed without root-cause details: ""Running `R CMD build`... ... installation of package ... had non-zero exit status"" followed by ""Error in library(lab) : there is no package called ‘lab’"".
The repository contains local R sources and data: file tree shows ""./R:"" and ""./data:"" and ""./code/SampleCode.Rmd"", indicating an alternative path existed (source local code) that the agent did not successfully execute to completion.",iter1_openai_o4-mini_2025-04-16_low
capsule-8536428,corebench,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: A benchmark/repo deficiency is present: the provided training scripts use an outdated pandas API signature, e.g. `DataFrame.drop(['Label'], 1)`, which errors under modern pandas versions (>=2.0) that require `axis` as a keyword. This is a reproducibility/maintenance defect in the repository code, but it is not an impassable infrastructure barrier because an agent can patch the scripts (or pin pandas<2) and proceed. | causation_reasoning: The run failed because the agent had not yet successfully completed the straightforward fix (change `drop(..., 1)` to `drop(..., axis=1)` or install an older pandas). This is recoverable via different agent actions (editing code or dependency pinning), so the failure is due to agent capability/process rather than an environmental barrier that no agent could overcome. | evidence: Both target scripts crash with pandas drop signature error:
- NB: `TypeError: DataFrame.drop() takes from 1 to 2 positional arguments but 3 were given` at `X = np.array(recipes.drop(['Label'], 1))`
- k-NN: `TypeError: DataFrame.drop() takes from 1 to 2 positional arguments but 3 were given` at `X = np.array(recipes.drop(['label'], 1))`
Additionally, earlier failures showed missing sklearn: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'sklearn'`, which the agent resolved by `pip install scikit-learn`.",iter1_openai_o4-mini_2025-04-16_low
capsule-9137200,corebench,1.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The run reveals a benchmark/environment setup deficiency: the code uses an absolute output directory (/results/) that does not exist in the execution environment and is not created by the repository or harness. This is an infrastructure/pathing issue rather than an algorithmic failure; the benchmark environment should provide the expected writable path or the code should use a relative path/create the directory. | causation_reasoning: The agent successfully executed the test computation and obtained the required metrics (precision/recall/F1 printed). The run is marked failed only because the program crashes at the end when attempting to write results to a non-existent absolute directory. Any agent would encounter the same crash unless modifying code or manually creating /results, which indicates the failure is due to the environment/path setup, not agent reasoning. | evidence: After successful evaluation output: ""Test result: p=0.9668  r=0.9638  f=0.9653"" followed by crash: ""FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/results/resume_test_result.txt'"" and earlier configuration shows absolute path usage: ""self.result_path = r'/results/'"" (found when searching /data/cache paths in NERController.py).",iter1_openai_o4-mini_2025-04-16_low
capsule-9832712,corebench,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: No clear benchmark/infrastructure deficiency is evidenced. The environment supports running shell commands and Rscript; the repository files are present (e.g., code/master_script.R, data/03_analyses/data_typofixes.csv). Failures stem from package installation/usage and output parsing mistakes rather than an impassable platform restriction (no ToS block, no read-only FS, no missing required input data, no sandbox ban on execute_bash, no harness crash). | causation_reasoning: The run failed due to agent-side issues: (1) running Rscript from the wrong working directory so sourced paths didn't resolve; (2) assuming packages were installed when they were not (tidyverse missing) and not successfully resolving installation; (3) repeated incorrect parsing of tool outputs that include wrappers like 'Exit Code/Stdout/Stderr', leading to ValueError/IndexError; (4) trying to use disallowed python_interpreter imports/open(), then attempting brittle CSV parsing via naive split on commas. None of these are mechanically impossible; a capable agent could fix by: running `cd code && Rscript master_script.R` after verifying installation (`Rscript -e 'packageVersion(""tidyverse"")'`), or bypassing tidyverse by editing 01_sampling.R to avoid tidyverse, or computing metrics entirely in base R and writing to a file then reading it with execute_bash robustly. The environment provides execute_bash and Rscript, so alternatives exist. | evidence: Working-directory mistake: `Rscript code/master_script.R` -> `cannot open file '01_scopus-selection/01_sampling.R': No such file or directory`.
Package missing: `Error in library(tidyverse) : there is no package called ‘tidyverse’` when running `cd code && Rscript master_script.R`.
Parsing/tool-output mistakes: `ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'Stdout:'` and later `ValueError ... 'Stderr:'`.
Python sandbox restrictions encountered but avoidable via execute_bash: `Import of csv is not allowed` and `Forbidden function evaluation: 'open'`.

capsule-9911222,corebench,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The run shows no impassable infrastructure defect (no container crash, no permission/read-only FS barrier, no sandbox block of required ops, no missing benchmark-provided data). The agent encountered correctable issues: (1) it tried to use the restricted `python_interpreter` to import `pandas` (not allowed) instead of using `execute_bash`/R/base Python parsing; (2) it failed to get R packages installed (devtools/rmarkdown not found) likely due to transient/incomplete installs and/or using the wrong R installation context (conda R 4.2.3 vs apt R 4.5.0), which could be resolved by installing packages in the active R library and rerunning with proper `.libPaths()`/`Rscript` path. Additionally, the agent ultimately found a correct alternative path to the answer by inspecting `ranked-groups.txt` and sorting it, indicating the environment did not make the task mechanically impossible. | causation_reasoning: Failure was due to agent capability/tooling choices, not an environmental barrier. The transcript shows it attempted to install R deps but then hit missing-package errors (devtools/rmarkdown/OncoBird), and separately tried to use `pandas` in a sandboxed python interpreter where imports are restricted. Both are overcome by using allowed tools (e.g., `execute_bash` for CSV parsing, ensuring CRAN install succeeds, using consistent R binary). The agent also produced a final answer blob but the run is marked failed due to formatting/interaction protocol issues (missing required code-block pattern earlier), again an agent-side issue. | evidence: Missing R packages after attempted install: ""Error in library(devtools) : there is no package called ‘devtools’"" and ""Error in loadNamespace(x) : there is no package called ‘rmarkdown’"" and ""Error in library(OncoBird) : there is no package called ‘OncoBird’"".
