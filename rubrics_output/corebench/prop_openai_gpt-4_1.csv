There is no indication of an impassable infrastructure problem (no crashes, permission errors, sandbox import blocks, missing system headers, or required network downloads). The agent’s inability to answer stems from its own incorrect interpretation/parsing of outputs (it assumed the HTML contained only boilerplate and did not use alternative extraction methods) and from a likely mismatch between the asked questions and the executed notebook’s content (the notebook does not discuss a 'hybrid filter wrapper strategy'). Neither issue is an environmental barrier under the rubric. | causation_reasoning: The run did not fail due to an infrastructure barrier: nbconvert completed and produced an HTML file. The agent failed because it relied on inspect_file_as_text() summaries that claimed keywords were absent and then concluded the answers were not determinable, instead of using robust text search (e.g., grep on the HTML), inspecting the executed notebook output structure, or directly computing the required values from the dataset by re-running relevant cells in a script. For the 'hybrid filter wrapper strategy' accuracy, the agent could have recognized that this question pertains to a different notebook (likely FS-Wrappers/FS-CFS) or combined analysis, and could have searched outputs across executed notebooks or computed it if defined elsewhere. These are capability/approach issues, not mechanical impossibilities. | evidence: Notebook execution and export succeeded: ""[NbConvertApp] Converting notebook code/FS-Filters.ipynb to html"" and ""Writing 507714 bytes to code/../results/FS-Filters.nb.html"".
No environmental errors during installation: pip install completed with Exit Code 0.
Agent’s extraction attempt relied on inspect_file_as_text responses claiming no matches, then it concluded: ""not present"" / ""not determinable"".
Agent also found by searching notebook sources that 'hybrid' is not mentioned: ""There are no cells ... that contain the word 'hybrid'"" (for FS-Filters and others), indicating a reasoning/task-mapping issue rather than an execution block.",prop_openai_gpt-4_1
capsule-2345790,corebench,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The transcript shows an R package installation/execution problem, but it does not establish an impassable infrastructure defect of the benchmark (e.g., network blocked, permission denied, missing system headers with no sudo, read-only FS, harness error). Instead, the agent’s approach to dependency resolution is incomplete: it assumes installation succeeded based on exit code and truncated logs, does not capture the real install failure reason for rmarkdown (likely visible earlier in the install output), and does not try alternative install avenues available in this environment (e.g., conda install r-rmarkdown, apt-get r-cran-rmarkdown, specifying dependencies=TRUE, checking/writing to a user library, examining the install log for the specific failure). Therefore, there is insufficient evidence of a benchmark deficiency. | causation_reasoning: The immediate failure was inability to load the R package rmarkdown when calling rmarkdown::render. The agent treated this as an environmental blocker without exhausting reasonable alternative installation/debug paths. Because alternative actions could plausibly resolve it (e.g., identify missing system dependency, use conda/apt binary packages, adjust library paths), the failure is attributed to agent capability/tooling rather than a proven impassable infrastructure defect. | evidence: Rendering attempts fail consistently with: ""Error in loadNamespace(x) : there is no package called ‘rmarkdown’"" (seen for each .Rmd in T0B50).
Agent previously ran a bulk install command but did not verify rmarkdown presence before rendering (T0B45-T0B50).
Even after ""Explicitly install rmarkdown"" (T0B51-T0B53), rmarkdown still missing; later confirms installed packages list lacks rmarkdown (T0B57, T0B62).
Agent concludes: ""persistent absence suggests a deeper environment or permissions issue ... cannot be resolved"" and aborts (T0B63) without showing the underlying installation error cause (install output was truncated) or trying other install methods.",prop_openai_gpt-4_1
capsule-3418007,corebench,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The failure stems from running the repository with a materially different dependency set than specified by the benchmark (the agent edited/relaxed requirements and installed modern versions). The repository appears to have the needed data files (e.g., data/features/time_features.txt exists) and no harness/network/permission failure is evidenced. While the pinned requirements are incompatible with Python 3.11 in this environment, that is not an impassable infrastructure defect under the rubric because an agent could resolve it by using a compatible Python version (e.g., 3.8/3.9) or otherwise matching the intended environment, rather than changing package versions in a way that breaks runtime behavior. | causation_reasoning: The run failed due to an in-process runtime error in sklearn metric computation (binary vs multilabel-indicator mismatch) after the agent installed a different sklearn/xgboost/numpy stack than the repo specifies. This is not mechanically impossible for all agents: an agent could have created/used a compatible environment (older Python + pinned deps) or patched the code/label handling to align y_true/y_pred formats. Therefore the failure is attributed to agent approach/environment management rather than an unavoidable benchmark infrastructure barrier. | evidence: Install failure with pinned deps: ""Collecting pandas==1.2.5 ... Getting requirements to build wheel: finished with status 'error'"" and numpy C-extension import error. Agent then modified requirements: ""edit_file(command=\""create\"", path=\""requirements.txt\"", content=edited_requirements3...)"" leading to successful install with modern versions: ""Requirement already satisfied: scikit-learn ... (1.8.0)"" and ""Collecting xgboost ... (3.1.3)"".

capsule-3821950,corebench,1.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The benchmark task requires rendering an RMarkdown document via Rscript (rmarkdown::render) after installing requirements from the README (including rmarkdown and a GitHub package). The environment appears to lack required R packages (notably rmarkdown) and also enforces network restrictions (stated in tool description) that prevent installing missing packages from CRAN/GitHub, which is necessary to proceed because no offline package bundle (packrat/renv) exists in the repo snapshot. This combination constitutes an environmental barrier: the infrastructure prevents completing the mandated render step regardless of agent skill. | causation_reasoning: The run fails because rmarkdown is missing and cannot be installed in this environment due to lack of internet access for package installation (and there is no local packrat/renv cache to restore from). Without rmarkdown, rendering the required ktc_11_paper.Rmd to HTML is mechanically impossible, so the agent cannot obtain the requested figure-derived answers via the required pathway. The agent's later attempt to infer answers from CSVs is an alternative workaround, but it does not satisfy the benchmark requirement to run the Rmd; the core failure is caused by the blocked dependency installation. | evidence: 1) Rendering attempt fails due to missing rmarkdown: ""Error in loadNamespace(x) : there is no package called ‘rmarkdown’"".
2) Installed package list shows no rmarkdown: printed installed.packages() output includes many packages but not ""rmarkdown"".
3) README requires rmarkdown and GitHub install: ""run rmarkdown::render(...)"" and ""devtools::install_github('benmarwick/ktc11')"".
4) No offline dependency cache: ""ls: cannot access 'code/packrat': No such file or directory"" and find for renv/lib yields nothing.

capsule-4252248,corebench,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The failure stems from unmet software dependencies rather than an impassable benchmark infrastructure defect. The environment allows apt-get and attempted R/Bioconductor installs, so the setup is not mechanically impossible in principle; the agent did not fully resolve dependency installation (e.g., selecting correct Debian package names, installing missing libs like r-cran-matrix, handling Bioconductor build requirements, or using prebuilt binaries/alternative repos). No clear evidence shows a sandbox restriction (read-only FS, blocked network, ToS block, harness error) that would prevent any agent from succeeding. | causation_reasoning: The run failed because required R packages (notably PharmacoGx and dependencies) were not installed, causing the R script to abort before producing outputs. This is an environment/setup/dependency-resolution problem that could potentially be overcome with different installation actions (installing missing system/R packages, using apt R packages, resolving 'configure' permissions), so it is categorized as an agent capability issue rather than an unavoidable environmental barrier. | evidence: R script failure: ""Error in library(PharmacoGx) : there is no package called ‘PharmacoGx’"".
Install attempt shows missing deps but not a hard sandbox block: ""ERROR: dependencies ‘curl’, ‘openssl’ are not available for package ‘httr’"" and ""ERROR: dependency ‘Matrix’ is not available for package ‘igraph’"".
Apt-get partially failed due to package-name availability: ""Package libatlas-base-dev is not available"" and ""Package libmariadb-client-lgpl-dev is not available"" (suggesting alternative package choices could work).",prop_openai_gpt-4_1
capsule-5136217,corebench,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: No clear benchmark/infrastructure deficiency is demonstrated. The environment supports bash execution, apt-get update, and Rscript execution, and many R packages are already installed. The transcript does not show an impassable system-level blocker such as network prohibition (apt-get worked), permission denial, missing required benchmark-provided data, or harness failure. The agent also made an incorrect assumption that package installation was impossible after incomplete/unchecked installs. | causation_reasoning: Failure was primarily due to agent capability/tool-use issues: (1) the agent attempted to install R packages via Rscript without checking the command output and likely without internet access for CRAN, then proceeded as if installation succeeded; (2) the agent ran scripts without following the task instruction to run them via Rscript with source() and echo=TRUE; (3) after encountering library(tidyverse) errors, the agent did not diagnose library paths or verify installed.packages() until late, at which point it found many packages present; (4) it then hallucinated/guessed answers instead of extracting them from generated figures or alternative sources. A better agent could have used execute_bash to (a) inspect R library paths (.libPaths()), (b) verify/install missing packages using Debian r-cran-* packages that do exist, (c) run scripts with the correct sourcing/echo requirement, and/or (d) extract needed values directly from data frames by running minimal R snippets even if full plotting failed. | evidence: Key failures shown in transcript:
- Scripts failing for missing packages: ""Error in library(tidyverse) : there is no package called ‘tidyverse’"" (similarly for haven, bsts) when running ""Rscript code/{script}"".
- Agent's package installation attempt did not check output: ""Attempted to install required R packages."" and ""Retried R package installation with explicit CRAN mirror."" but no install logs were inspected.
- Apt-get attempt partially failed but agent didn't continue with available packages: ""E: Unable to locate package r-cran-stargazer"" and ""E: Unable to locate package r-cran-reldist""; then ""Test tidyverse load... no package called ‘tidyverse’"".
- Later evidence that many R packages are installed (contradicting the 'cannot install' conclusion): installed.packages output includes ""dplyr"", ""ggplot2"", ""lmtest"", ""sandwich"", ""stargazer"", ""matrixStats"", ""urltools"", ""rjson"" etc.
- Results folders empty due to scripts not running: ""results/for_publication/figures directory is empty"" and ""No intermediate figures are present"".

capsule-7186268,corebench,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: No clear impassable infrastructure defect is evidenced. The agent successfully installed dependencies (including via conda) and successfully rendered the RMarkdown to an HTML file. The agent then incorrectly concluded the HTML had no scientific content based on a flawed inspection approach/tool interaction, rather than proving the benchmark setup is missing required data or that the rendering produced an empty/incorrect artifact due to environment failure. | causation_reasoning: The failure was caused by agent capability/tool-use issues in extracting information from the generated HTML, not by an environmental barrier. The render completed successfully (so the pipeline worked), but the agent relied on inspect_file_as_text outputs that appeared to show only the HTML header/CSS and then stopped, instead of using alternative extraction methods (e.g., grep/search within the HTML via execute_bash, splitting/targeted search for '18262-6'/'2160-0' strings, checking file size, verifying body content, inspecting the intermediate SampleCode.knit.md, or rendering to a different format). Therefore, an alternative approach could have succeeded. | evidence: Successful render: ""Preview created: ../results/SampleCode.html\n\nOutput created: ../results/SampleCode.html"".
Failure point: agent inspection returned only header/CSS and agent concluded: ""The rendered HTML file does not contain any relevant scientific content... Since the result file contains no data, I must return 'None'"".

capsule-8536428,corebench,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The repository scripts contain benchmark/environment-sensitive defects: (1) hard-coded absolute data paths (e.g., /data/Combined_Corpus/Train/...) that did not exist in the run environment, and (2) deprecated pandas API usage (DataFrame.drop(['col'], 1)) incompatible with the installed pandas version, requiring axis=1. These are deficiencies in the artifact/benchmark packaging because the code is not directly runnable as provided in this environment without edits. | causation_reasoning: Although these deficiencies initially prevented execution, the agent successfully overcame them by editing the scripts to point to available local CSVs and updating pandas drop syntax. The run ultimately produced the required metrics, and the agent even constructed the final results dictionary in the transcript. Therefore, the benchmark deficiencies did not cause the overall failure; the agent could have completed submission (the remaining failure state appears unrelated to an impassable infrastructure barrier). Under the Environmental Barrier rubric, this is not mechanically impossible for any agent—an agent can fix paths/use correct working directory and update deprecated API—so score=0. | evidence: Initial hard-coded missing path failures:
- ""FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/data/Combined_Corpus/Train/fulltrain_Guardian_Nyt_binary_shuffled_clean.csv'"" (NB ngram)

capsule-9137200,corebench,1.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The run environment lacks required local model assets that the code hard-depends on. The code attempts to load a BERT model from a fixed local path (/data/bert-base-chinese/). Without those files present in the benchmark/container filesystem, the task is mechanically impossible under the stated no-internet constraint because the model cannot be downloaded and the path cannot resolve. This is an infrastructure/setup deficiency: required data/model files that should have been provided are missing. | causation_reasoning: This missing local BERT model directory directly caused the execution to crash during PGAT_Model initialization, preventing any test run and thus preventing extraction of precision/recall/f1. No alternative agent strategy can overcome the absence of the required model files given the environment disallows internet access for downloads; patching the code to avoid BERT would violate the instruction to run PGAT/main.py as intended for the benchmark results. | evidence: Failure when running: `python3 code/PGAT/main.py --state test --source_type resume ...`.

capsule-9832712,corebench,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: No clear infrastructure-level defect is demonstrated. The run fails due to a missing R package (tidyverse). This is generally solvable by installing the package (or its constituent packages) via standard R installation methods, or by adjusting R library paths. The transcript does not show an impassable restriction like network denial, read-only filesystem preventing installs, missing system headers with no sudo, Conda ToS block, or sandbox import bans. | causation_reasoning: The immediate cause of failure is that `library(tidyverse)` cannot find the package when running `Rscript`. The agent attempted `install.packages(...)`, but did not verify install success (e.g., by checking `installed.packages()` / `library(tidyverse)` in a test call) and did not inspect installation stderr/return codes (they only observed compiler output). They also did not try alternative approaches like installing to an explicit writable library (setting `R_LIBS_USER`), using conda/apt R packages, or installing the individual tidyverse components used by the scripts. Therefore this is not shown to be mechanically impossible; it is an agent/tooling/diagnosis issue. | evidence: Failure when running from correct working directory:
- ""Error in library(tidyverse) : there is no package called ‘tidyverse’\nCalls: source -> withVisible -> eval -> eval -> library\nExecution halted"" (after `cd code && Rscript master_script.R`).

Multiple packages fail during source installation with the infrastructure-level error ""'configure' exists but is not executable"", indicating the environment prevents running package configure scripts (a mechanical build barrier), and also reports missing core dependency packages (e.g., Matrix). This is not something an agent can fix via alternative reasoning; it requires a different environment configuration (correct executable permissions and/or availability of prebuilt binaries/system headers/libs). | causation_reasoning: This deficiency directly blocks installing dependencies needed to install the local OncoBird R package, which is required by the vignette (it calls library(OncoBird)). Since OncoBird cannot be installed, the vignette cannot be rendered, so the agent cannot obtain the requested model name.
