capsule-1624349,corebench,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: No clear infrastructure or harness deficiency is evidenced. The notebook execution and HTML export completed successfully, packages were installable via pip, and there were no permission/network/kernel failures. The agent’s later inability to extract answers stems from its approach (misinterpreting HTML contents, not programmatically extracting results from executed notebook/artifacts) rather than an impassable environment restriction. | causation_reasoning: Failure was caused by agent capability issues: it did not properly inspect the produced HTML (507KB) using robust text search (e.g., grep) or parse the executed notebook outputs; it relied on inspect_file_as_text Q&A prompts that produced misleading summaries (e.g., claiming no 'accuracy' in the file) and then guessed an answer ('VEDGE-MEAN') and declared the hybrid result 'not found' without checking other notebooks (e.g., FS-Wrappers.ipynb) or extracting computed values directly by re-running code to print top MI feature and max accuracy. These are solvable with better tooling/verification; not mechanically blocked. | evidence: Notebook execution succeeded and wrote HTML: ""[NbConvertApp] Writing 507429 bytes to ../results/FS-Filters.html"". No environment crash/permission/network issue is shown; pip installs succeeded: ""Exit Code: 0"" and ""Downloading scikit_learn..."". The agent’s extraction failed due to tool/approach: it used inspect_file_as_text on the HTML and concluded no keywords present (e.g., ""There are no lines containing 'accuracy'"") and later guessed: ""fig Report the name of the feature with the highest I-Gain."": ""VEDGE-MEAN"" and stated hybrid accuracy ""Not found or not applicable"" without demonstrating exhaustive search or computing outputs.",iter1_openai_gpt-4_1
capsule-2345790,corebench,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The transcript shows no clear impassable infrastructure defect (e.g., no container crash, permission denial, network block, missing system headers without sudo, ToS block, or harness error). The main blockers observed are (a) the agent's misuse of the sandboxed python_interpreter (attempting disallowed imports like os) and (b) failure to successfully proceed with RMarkdown rendering despite having avenues to debug/resolve it within the environment (e.g., verify rmarkdown is installed/available to the same Rscript, adjust library paths, use execute_bash directly, or run R non-interactively to render). The environment provides execute_bash, which can run Rscript; therefore, the task is not mechanically impossible in principle based on the evidence provided. | causation_reasoning: The run failed because the agent did not complete rendering and then declared the answers unavailable, even though alternative actions were available. The 'Import of os is not allowed' error is explicitly a sandbox restriction of python_interpreter, but it does not block the task because the agent could avoid python_interpreter for filesystem/string needs (use execute_bash, or pure string ops), which they later did. The later 'there is no package called rmarkdown' error might be resolvable by further debugging (checking libPaths(), ensuring the same R library is used, installing rmarkdown into the active lib, etc.). The agent stopped without exhausting these options and also could have extracted the means by running a minimal Rscript that computes them directly from the data rather than relying on rmarkdown rendering. Thus the failure is attributable to agent approach/tooling decisions rather than an unavoidable environmental barrier. | evidence: 1) Sandbox import limitation (workaround exists): ""InterpreterError: Import of os is not allowed. Authorized imports are: [...]"".
2) R rendering failure encountered but not proven impossible: repeated errors during render attempts: ""Error in loadNamespace(x) : there is no package called ‘rmarkdown’"".
3) Agent gave up instead of alternative computation/rendering: ""The file_content_search shows ... but since we cannot render or run R, there is not enough information ... Therefore, I will report that ... is not possible in this environment."" (Despite having execute_bash(Rscript) available and having already run multiple Rscript commands.)",iter1_openai_gpt-4_1
capsule-3418007,corebench,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The transcript shows a reproducibility run that is blocked initially by dependency/version issues and incorrect working directory assumptions, but these are not benchmark/harness infrastructure defects. The repository appears to include the required feature-list files under data/features/, and the agent was able to install dependencies after adjusting versions for Python 3.11. The later failure is a runtime error in metrics computation, not a harness failure, container crash, network/permission restriction, or missing benchmark-provided files proven absent. The agent also incorrectly concludes the dataset is empty based on a truncated header view, despite earlier evidence showing data rows exist. | causation_reasoning: The failure was not caused by an impassable environmental barrier. After installation, running from the correct directory progressed until a scikit-learn ValueError about incompatible target formats. Additionally, the agent made avoidable mistakes: (1) initially ran main.py from the wrong working directory causing FileNotFoundError; (2) later misdiagnosed the CSV as header-only even though earlier search output included numeric row content. A more capable agent could inspect the CSV properly (e.g., wc -l, head -n 5), inspect utils.read_data/target processing, and fix/patch label handling to complete the run and extract F1/AUC. Therefore, this is an agent capability/approach issue rather than an infrastructure impossibility. | evidence: Install initially failed due to old pinned deps on Python 3.11: ""NumPy 1.19.5 may not yet support Python 3.11"" and later build issues; agent edited requirements to proceed.
Wrong working directory caused missing file: running ""python3 code/main.py"" raised ""FileNotFoundError: ... '../data/features/time_features.txt'"".
When run from code/ it progressed but failed with runtime metric error: ""ValueError: Classification metrics can't handle a mix of binary and multilabel-indicator targets"".
Agent misdiagnosed data as empty, but earlier file search output shows a data row snippet: in file_content_search results for data/us_2020_election_data.csv it includes ""... (truncated) ... 403809,-6.717607498168945,..."" indicating rows exist.",iter1_openai_gpt-4_1
capsule-3821950,corebench,1.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The run encountered a low-level compilation/configuration failure when attempting to install required R package dependencies, specifically failing to find the V8 engine headers/libraries (v8.h / libv8). This indicates the environment lacks required system dependencies (e.g., libv8-dev/libnode-dev) needed to compile certain R packages from source. In the given sandbox, the agent cannot install OS-level dependencies (no sudo/apt-get assumed) and thus this is an infrastructure/environment barrier rather than a reasoning mistake. | causation_reasoning: This missing system dependency prevented successful installation (or reinstallation with dependencies=TRUE) of packages needed to render the R Markdown (directly or indirectly). Consequently, `rmarkdown::render(...)` could not run, and the agent could not generate the required HTML output to extract the figure-derived answers. Because rendering the Rmd as instructed was mechanically blocked by missing system headers/libraries, the failure is attributable to an environmental barrier. | evidence: Key failure during dependency installation:
- ""Configuration failed to find the libv8 engine library. Try installing: * deb: libv8-dev or libnode-dev"" and ""fatal error: v8.h: No such file or directory"".
Rendering remained impossible and produced: ""Error in loadNamespace(x) : there is no package called ‘rmarkdown’"" when attempting `rmarkdown::render(...)`.
These show the environment could not satisfy required compiled dependencies needed for the benchmark-mandated Rmd rendering.",iter1_openai_gpt-4_1
capsule-4252248,corebench,1.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The run requires installing R/CRAN/Bioconductor dependencies (notably PharmacoGx) to execute the provided R scripts and generate the PR AUC. The environment/tooling indicates that internet access is not available for bash executions (""Will not execute commands requiring internet access""), which makes installing missing packages from CRAN/Bioconductor mechanically impossible if they are not already preinstalled or vendored. This constitutes an environmental barrier because no agent can fetch and install the missing dependencies without network access or a pre-provisioned package cache. | causation_reasoning: The failure occurs because `main-ctrpv.R` immediately errors due to a missing required package (`PharmacoGx`). Since the environment restricts network access needed to install that missing package (and there are no precomputed outputs in `results/` to extract the AUC without running the pipeline), the agent cannot proceed to generate the PR curve/AUC. Thus the infrastructure/network restriction directly causes the failure. | evidence: 1) Script execution failure: ""Error in library(PharmacoGx) : there is no package called ‘PharmacoGx’\nExecution halted"" (from running `cd code && Rscript main-ctrpv.R`).\n2) Environment limitation: execute_bash tool description states: ""Will not execute commands requiring internet access.""\n3) No precomputed outputs to bypass execution: listing `results` shows only the symlink and no files; grep for PR/ROC figures returns nothing (""ls -l results | grep -i 'PR\|ROC\|pdf\|png'"" produced no stdout).",iter1_openai_gpt-4_1
capsule-5136217,corebench,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: No clear infrastructure/harness deficiency is evidenced. The repository contains the expected code and data files (e.g., bazaars_figure_map.csv) and the script 11_prepare_for_publication.R clearly copies PDFs from results/figures to results/for_publication/figures, implying that earlier scripts should generate PDFs. The transcript does not show any impassable system restriction (no permission/network/ToS/compiler-header errors, no crashes). The absence of outputs could be due to silent script errors, wrong working directory/paths, suppressed errors, or not actually executing R scripts correctly/logging output—none of which are proven to be benchmark deficiencies. | causation_reasoning: Failure is attributable to agent execution/diagnostics rather than an environmental barrier. The agent claims scripts ran 'with no errors' but does not capture/inspect stderr/stdout for each script (the tool output was truncated and then not checked). The agent also did not verify that R actually executed successfully, nor re-run with proper working directory (README says set wd to ./code) or check for script stops (e.g., missing packages beyond the four installed, missing LaTeX/ghostscript for PDF generation, etc.). Because alternative actions could likely have produced figures or at least surfaced actionable errors, this is not mechanically impossible for any agent. | evidence: Key trace points:
- README indicates outputs should be in ./results/for_publication/figures and that replication is initiated by setting working directory to ./code and running run.sh: ""set the working directory to the ./code/ folder and then run the bash script run.sh."" (but agent does not find run.sh and proceeds manually).
- Agent creates folders successfully: ""mkdir -p results/tables results/figures results/for_publication/tables results/for_publication/figures"" and lists them empty.
- Agent installs only four R packages inferred from three scripts: bsts, stargazer, ggpubr, tidyverse.
- Agent runs scripts via Rscript source but does not show outputs/errors: ""The actual output was too long to display (truncated), but no errors were reported"".
- After running, results are empty: ""ls results/for_publication/figures"" shows empty; ""find results -type f"" shows no files.
- 11_prepare_for_publication.R copies from ../results/figures/*.pdf, and figure_map shows figure 3 maps to portal_pid.pdf, but results/figures is empty: ""results/figures:"" (empty) and mapping line ""main_figure_3,portal_pid"".
These do not demonstrate an impassable infrastructure defect; they show missing/undetected execution success or unmet dependencies.",iter1_openai_gpt-4_1
capsule-7186268,corebench,1.00,0,"existence_reasoning: A benchmark/environment deficiency exists: required system-level libraries for installing key R packages are missing or incompatible in the provided execution environment. Specifically, installing the R package V8 fails due to missing linkable V8 libraries (-lv8, -lv8_libplatform). Since rmarkdown installation (and thus rendering SampleCode.Rmd to HTML) depends on successfully installing its dependency chain in this environment, the task becomes mechanically impossible to complete as specified. | causation_reasoning: The run failed because rmarkdown could not be installed/loaded, preventing rmarkdown::render() from running. The transcript shows repeated successful-looking install attempts that nonetheless leave rmarkdown unavailable, and later reveals compilation/linking failures involving V8 system libraries. Without rmarkdown, rendering an .Rmd to HTML via Rscript cannot proceed, so no agent can extract the figure-derived answers. This is not an agent reasoning issue; it is blocked by missing/invalid system dependencies in the environment. | evidence: Render failure: ""Error in loadNamespace(x) : there is no package called ‘rmarkdown’"".
Repeated checks: ""rmarkdown MISSING"" after install attempts.
Root cause surfaced during forced install: ""Configuration failed to find the libv8 engine library"" and ""fatal error: v8.h: No such file or directory"".
After apt install attempt, V8 still fails to link: ""/opt/conda/.../ld: cannot find -lv8: No such file or directory"" and ""cannot find -lv8_libplatform"".

capsule-8536428,corebench,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: No impassable infrastructure/benchmark deficiency is evidenced. The run encountered missing dependencies (sklearn), outdated pandas API usage (DataFrame.drop positional arg), and hard-coded absolute paths (/data/..., /code/...) that did not exist in this environment. All of these were overcome by installing scikit-learn, patching drop() calls to use axis=1, replacing absolute paths with local filenames, and running scripts from the correct working directory. The presence of required CSVs inside the repo further indicates the environment was not missing benchmark-provided data in an unrecoverable way. | causation_reasoning: The final marked failure of the agent run is not attributable to an environmental barrier. Earlier errors were agent-addressable and were in fact resolved. Since the agent successfully executed both target scripts and obtained the required metrics, any remaining 'failed: true' status is unrelated to an impassable infrastructure defect per the rubric. | evidence: Initial failures were: ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'sklearn' (both scripts) and TypeError: DataFrame.drop() takes from 1 to 2 positional arguments but 3 were given. Later FileNotFoundError came from hardcoded absolute paths: ""/code/Traditional_ML_based_Methods/.../Mixed_and_fulltrain.csv"" and similar. The agent verified the files exist locally via `ls -l` in the directories. After replacing absolute paths and running from the script directories, both scripts succeeded: NB printed test_accuracy 0.7539580658964484 etc., and k-NN printed test_accuracy 0.77378405363001 etc. (Exit Code: 0 for both).",iter1_openai_gpt-4_1
capsule-9137200,corebench,1.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The benchmark requires running PGAT with specific legacy dependencies (Python 3.8, torch 1.7.1, transformers 4.2.1 per README). The execution environment is Python 3.11 (as indicated by the site-packages path) where torch==1.7.1 wheels are unavailable and transformers==4.2.1 pulls tokenizers==0.9.4 which fails to build. This is an infrastructure/environment mismatch that prevents any agent from installing the required dependencies in this container without the ability to change Python version or obtain compatible wheels/source toolchains. | causation_reasoning: The run failed because the agent could not install torch and could not complete installing transformers due to tokenizers build failure, and torch was not present afterward. Without torch/transformers, PGAT/main.py cannot be executed to produce precision/recall/F1. Since the inability to install required versions stems from the environment (Python 3.11) and package availability/build constraints, alternative agent actions would not overcome it under the same restrictions. | evidence: README requirements: ""python 3.8"", ""pytorch 1.7.1"", ""transformers  4.2.1"".

The main blocking issue was an R package availability problem for the meta-package 'tidyverse'. However, other CRAN packages (e.g., 'readr') installed successfully, indicating that package installation and compilation were possible in principle. This suggests the situation was not a universal, mechanically impossible barrier attributable to the environment/harness. | causation_reasoning: The agent failed because it could not successfully install/load the 'tidyverse' package required by the scripts, and then did not take the most direct alternative that could have enabled progress: modify the R scripts to replace `library(tidyverse)` with the specific component packages already installed/available (dplyr, ggplot2, tidyr, readr, etc.), or adjust .libPaths/installation diagnostics more systematically (e.g., inspect install logs, check library directories, install binary vs source, etc.). The environment allowed installs and had many tidyverse components installed; thus another agent could plausibly overcome this by different actions. | evidence: Failure when running master script from correct directory:
- ""cd code && Rscript master_script.R"" -> ""Error in library(tidyverse) : there is no package called ‘tidyverse’"".
Attempts to install tidyverse did not make it appear installed:

capsule-9911222,corebench,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The transcript shows no clear, impassable infrastructure defect (e.g., blocked network, read-only FS, missing system headers with no sudo, sandbox import restrictions). The key blocker was failure to get the R package `rmarkdown` installed/visible to R, but the run does not provide evidence that the environment fundamentally prevents installing packages (e.g., explicit network denial, permission denial, ToS blocks). The install attempts may have been incomplete/incorrectly verified (e.g., library paths, install logs truncated, dependency failures not inspected). Thus no benchmark/environment deficiency is established. | causation_reasoning: The agent failed because `rmarkdown` was not available at render time (`there is no package called ‘rmarkdown’`). However, the transcript does not demonstrate this was mechanically impossible for any agent; it could plausibly be resolved by deeper diagnosis (checking full install output for errors, verifying `.libPaths()` during install vs render, setting `R_LIBS_USER`, using `install.packages(..., lib=...)` with explicit `dependencies=TRUE`, or using alternative rendering mechanisms). Therefore the failure is attributed to agent capability/tooling/debugging rather than an impassable environmental barrier. | evidence: Key failure: ""Error in loadNamespace(x) : there is no package called ‘rmarkdown’"" when running render.
