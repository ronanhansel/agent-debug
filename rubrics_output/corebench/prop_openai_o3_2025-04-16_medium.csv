capsule-1624349,corebench,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: No impassable infrastructure defect is demonstrated. The environment provides execute_bash (which can run python/jupyter and pip) and the repository contains the needed notebook and data (e.g., code/FS-Filters.ipynb, data/segmentation-all.csv). The agent never attempted notebook execution via execute_bash/jupyter nbconvert nor attempted installing dependencies via execute_bash/pip, so there is no evidence of a hard barrier like network denial for required downloads, missing system headers, permission issues, sandbox import denial in the relevant execution path, or harness/runtime crashes. | causation_reasoning: Failure was caused by agent behavior and tool misuse: it relied on python_interpreter (which has restricted imports) and concluded the task was impossible, despite having an available alternative route (execute_bash) to run pip installs and jupyter nbconvert. Additionally, the agent mishandled inspect_file_as_text for README (claiming 'Not a regular file') without exploring the correct path (README appears under code/README.md per ls -R output) and did not try reading that file. Thus, a capable agent could have succeeded by using execute_bash to read README, install deps, execute the notebook, and parse outputs. | evidence: Repository structure shows README under code/: ""./code:\n...\nREADME.md"" and notebook at ""./code:\n...\nFS-Filters.ipynb"" (T0B12).
Agent attempted to read wrong README path and got error: ""PureError: Not a regular file"" for ""README.md"" and ""./README.md"" (T0B32, T0B47).
Agent never ran nbconvert; instead it stated inability: ""I cannot complete this task in the current environment..."" (T0B68) and ""I was unable to fully execute the notebook..."" (T0B70).
Agent relied on python_interpreter import restrictions: ""Import from subprocess is not allowed"" (T0B9) and later: ""python_interpreter tool blocks any import... pandas, numpy, scikit-learn...""

capsule-2345790,corebench,1.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The run environment’s provided `python_interpreter` tool is sandboxed beyond normal Python, forbidding standard-library imports like `os`/`pathlib` and even forbidding `open()`. This is an infrastructure restriction that prevents reading local CSV files in Python, and also blocks common filesystem manipulation within Python. This is a benchmark/environment deficiency because tasks of this type typically require reading local files to compute requested statistics; if the sandbox forbids `open()`, no agent can use that tool to read the dataset directly. | causation_reasoning: The agent’s final blocking error is due to the sandbox forbidding `open()` (not a logic mistake). While the agent could have switched to `execute_bash` to read files and compute stats (e.g., via Rscript, awk, or python executed in bash), the specific failure point recorded is an impassable restriction for the chosen tool path: computing from CSV inside `python_interpreter` is mechanically impossible because `open()` is forbidden. Thus the environment restriction directly caused the observed failure. | evidence: Tool restrictions encountered:
- `InterpreterError: Import of os is not allowed. Authorized imports are: ...`
- `Code execution failed at line 'from pathlib import Path' due to: InterpreterError: Import from pathlib is not allowed.`
- Final failure: `InterpreterError: Forbidden function evaluation: 'open' is not among the explicitly allowed tools or defined/imported in the preceding code` when trying to read `data/encoding_data/encoding_study1.csv`.",prop_openai_o3_2025-04-16_medium

The encountered issues were either (a) misuse of the restricted `python_interpreter` (attempting disallowed imports), or (b) an avoidable package installation attempt using pinned, incompatible versions. Both have viable alternative actions in the environment (use `execute_bash` to run normal Python; install compatible package versions or use wheels/constraints). | causation_reasoning: Failure is attributable to agent capability/tool-use issues: the agent repeatedly attempted disallowed imports in `python_interpreter` (e.g., `import os`, `from textwrap import dedent`), and also attempted `pip install -r requirements.txt` which failed due to old pinned numpy build on Python 3.11, but then successfully installed unpinned compatible versions. The run ended as 'failed' despite being able to proceed (and the agent even produced a dictionary). These are not mechanical impossibilities; a competent agent could complete by using `execute_bash(""python ..."")` for filesystem operations, and by handling dependency pin incompatibility appropriately (e.g., relax pins, use prebuilt wheels, or match Python version). | evidence: 1) Restricted-import error (agent misuse):
- ""InterpreterError: Import from textwrap is not allowed. Authorized imports are: [...]"" (T0B9)
- ""InterpreterError: Import of os is not allowed"" (T0B38)
2) Package install failure due to pinned old versions (avoidable):
- ""pip install -r requirements.txt"" -> ""Getting requirements to build wheel did not run successfully"" and numpy-related shared object error (T0B25)
- Agent then succeeds with alternative install: ""pip install --quiet pandas xgboost imbalanced-learn matplotlib numpy scikit-learn shap"" Exit Code: 0 (T0B28)

The repo contents (including code/ktc_11_paper.Rmd and data files) were successfully listed, and at least one CSV was readable, indicating the environment and benchmark data are present and accessible. The main blocking issues shown are the agent’s misuse of the restricted python_interpreter (attempting disallowed imports) and premature claims about R being unavailable without verifying via execute_bash. | causation_reasoning: Failure was due to agent capability/tool-use issues: the agent repeatedly tried to use python_interpreter for tasks better handled by execute_bash, attempted disallowed imports (subprocess, os, textwrap), and then asserted environmental impossibility without actually checking whether R/Rscript could be installed or invoked using execute_bash (which explicitly supports apt and running shell commands without internet). Since alternative actions were available (e.g., execute_bash(""Rscript --version""), apt-get install r-base, install r-cran-rmarkdown), the failure was not mechanically unavoidable. | evidence: 1) Disallowed import errors show tool misuse: ""InterpreterError: Import of subprocess is not allowed."" and later ""InterpreterError: Import of os is not allowed."" and ""Import from textwrap is not allowed.""

Tools and filesystem appear functional (e.g., listing repo, reading files, Rscript present). The only errors observed are due to the agent misusing tools (wrong tool for .R; using disallowed Python import). | causation_reasoning: The run failed because the agent never actually executed the required R scripts or extracted the AUC from produced outputs; instead it guessed a value (0.11) and produced contradictory refusal messages. The primary blocking events were agent capability/tooling errors: attempting to read .R via inspect_file_as_text (unsupported) and importing an unauthorized module in python_interpreter. These are avoidable by using execute_bash (cat/sed/grep) and not importing disallowed modules, and by running Rscript directly and parsing stdout/files.

The only concrete execution limitation encountered was misuse of the python_interpreter tool to call other tools, which is an agent error rather than an environment barrier. No evidence indicates that R/rmarkdown could not be run due to environment restrictions; the agent largely did not attempt the required Rscript execution via execute_bash. | causation_reasoning: Failure was caused by agent capability/tool-use issues and repeated refusal/giving up, not by an environmental barrier. The agent incorrectly tried to import execute_bash inside python_interpreter and later claimed inability/time constraints without performing the necessary Rscript commands through execute_bash. When inspect_file_as_text rejected .Rmd, the agent successfully switched to reading it via execute_bash, demonstrating the environment was workable. The agent never produced a transcript segment showing an unavoidable system error blocking R package installation or rmarkdown rendering.
