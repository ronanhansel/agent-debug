capsule-1624349,corebench,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: No clear benchmark/infrastructure deficiency is evidenced. The environment appears functional: repository files are present (including the target notebook), shell commands run successfully, and the issue encountered is due to the agent misusing tools (calling a restricted python interpreter with unavailable functions) and mishandling file reading/parsing rather than an impassable system restriction (no network/permission/header/ToS/harness crash evidence). | causation_reasoning: The failure stems from agent capability/tool-use errors. The agent attempted to run shell commands via python_interpreter (which cannot access execute_bash), triggering an execution failure. Later, instead of properly executing nbconvert and then parsing the resulting HTML for the required metrics, the agent ended up with (or provided) an HTML snippet that contains only boilerplate header/CSS and then concluded results were not found. A more capable agent could have: (1) run execute_bash directly (not via python_interpreter), (2) open ./code/README.md using execute_bash (cat/sed) rather than inspect_file_as_text if symlink/regular-file issues occur, (3) rerun nbconvert and verify output file size/content, (4) grep the executed HTML for 'hybrid', 'accuracy', 'I-Gain', or extract from notebook outputs directly. Nothing indicates the task was mechanically impossible. | evidence: Tool misuse error: ""Calling tools: [{'id': 'call_3', ... 'function': {'name': 'python_interpreter', 'arguments': '... execute_bash(...) ...'}}]"" followed by failure: ""Error: Code execution failed ... due to: PureError: Not a regular file"" and earlier the attempt to call python_interpreter with empty arguments.

The provided HTML excerpt is only header/CSS boilerplate and lacks results, consistent with incomplete parsing/verification rather than an infrastructure block.",prop_openai_gpt-5_2025
capsule-2345790,corebench,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: No impassable infrastructure/benchmark defect is evidenced. The failure arose from the agent’s incorrect tool usage: it attempted to run shell and file-inspection tools inside the restricted python_interpreter tool, and also targeted a non-existent README path (./README.md) even though the repository contained a README at a different location (./code/README.md). These are correctable with different actions (use execute_bash directly; use correct file paths). No indication of crashes, permission issues, missing dependencies, network blocks, or harness breakage. | causation_reasoning: The run failed because the python_interpreter call attempted to execute execute_bash/inspect_file_as_text, and then it tried to inspect ./README.md which was not a regular file. Any agent could have succeeded by (1) calling execute_bash as a tool rather than inside python_interpreter, and (2) reading the correct README file path returned by find (./code/README.md). Therefore the failure is an agent capability issue, not an environmental barrier. | evidence: Tool call attempted within python_interpreter: the call_2 payload contains lines like ""readme_list = execute_bash(...)"" and ""readme_content = inspect_file_as_text(file_path=\""./README.md\"", ...)"".
The environment showed the actual README path: Stdout: ""./code/README.md"".

capsule-3418007,corebench,1.00,0,"existence_reasoning: A benchmark/environment deficiency exists: the agent is required to install pinned scientific Python dependencies (pandas, numpy, xgboost, etc.) but pip installation fails in this sandbox due to inability to build/import required binary wheels/compiled extensions under the provided Python/runtime constraints. This is an infrastructure-level barrier because the task explicitly requires installing requirements and running main.py; without pandas/xgboost the code cannot run at all. | causation_reasoning: This deficiency directly caused the failure. The agent attempted to install requirements and run the code, but could not get required packages installed/importable. As a result, main.py and performance_measurement.py crash immediately with ModuleNotFoundError for core dependencies, preventing any generation of performance.txt or ROC figures needed to answer the questions. No alternative reasoning/tool choice would allow running the intended pipeline without these dependencies. | evidence: Pip install failure for required deps:
- ""ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement pandas==1.2.5"" (earlier attempt)
- Later attempt shows build failure: ""Getting requirements to build wheel did not run successfully"" followed by ""ImportError: ... numpy ... failed to map segment from shared object"".
Runtime failures due to missing deps:
- ""ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'xgboost'"" when running main.py.

capsule-3821950,corebench,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: No evidence of an impassable infrastructure/benchmark defect is shown. The environment appears functional: repository files are present, Rscript and pandoc are installed, and directory creation succeeded. The only encountered errors are tool-usage limitations/misuse: attempting to use python_interpreter with disallowed imports and trying to read a .Rmd via inspect_file_as_text despite unsupported format. These do not indicate a broken benchmark setup; alternative available approaches exist (bash tools to view the Rmd, and running Rscript to render). | causation_reasoning: The run failed because the agent did not complete the task after encountering non-fatal tool limitations. The agent could have proceeded by using execute_bash to view the Rmd (as they later did with sed), install needed R packages, render via Rscript, and then parse the resulting HTML (supported by inspect_file_as_text). Since the environment supports the required operations, the failure is attributable to agent progress/decision issues rather than an environmental barrier. | evidence: Tool limitation/misuse: ""InterpreterError: Import from pathlib is not allowed"" when using python_interpreter.
Tool limitation: ""UnsupportedFormatException: Could not convert 'code/ktc_11_paper.Rmd' to Markdown. The formats ['.Rmd'] are not supported."" (agent could use execute_bash instead).

capsule-4252248,corebench,1.00,0,"existence_reasoning: A benchmark/environment deficiency exists: the environment cannot install required R package dependencies needed to run the provided scripts, due to missing core R packages (e.g., Matrix/MASS) and inability to build source packages requiring executable configure scripts. This prevents the repository scripts from running as required to compute the requested PR AUC. These are infrastructure-level constraints rather than reasoning/tool-choice mistakes, because the failures occur at package installation/runtime dependency resolution and block any agent from executing the intended pipeline in this container without changing the environment/base image. | causation_reasoning: The run failed because critical R packages could not be installed or loaded (PharmacoGx, igraph, apcluster, rcdk/rJava, Matrix). Consequently, executing main-ctrpv.R, main-nci.R, and main-network-generation.R halted immediately at library() calls, so the PR-curve AUC output could not be generated/extracted. The agent attempted alternatives (CRAN installs, BiocManager installs, apt-get for r-cran-igraph, and even commenting out library(PharmacoGx)), but the underlying environment still lacked the required dependencies and/or could not compile them, making the task mechanically impossible in this setup. | evidence: Runtime failures:

capsule-5136217,corebench,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The run shows no impassable infrastructure defect. The environment provides Rscript (R 4.2.3) and a writable results directory. The failure stemmed from missing R packages (e.g., tidyverse, haven, bsts), which is not inherently an environmental barrier because an agent could attempt offline installation via apt/pip prebuilt packages, use a local package cache, or adapt to the repository's provided run.sh/conda environment if specified. No evidence of network prohibition explicitly blocking required downloads during an attempted install, no permission errors on required paths, and no harness crash is shown. The benchmark inputs (data files and mapping CSVs) appear present. | causation_reasoning: The agent failed because it did not successfully install required R packages and therefore could not execute the R scripts to generate figures. This is a capability/process issue (dependency installation strategy and execution), not a mechanically impossible condition imposed by the environment. The agent then guessed an answer (""Strong REP"") without being able to compute or read the generated figure, which further indicates agent-side failure rather than benchmark infrastructure deficiency. | evidence: Rscript is available: ""Checking Rscript -----\n/opt/conda/bin/Rscript\nRscript (R) version 4.2.3"".

capsule-7186268,corebench,1.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The benchmark environment appears mis-provisioned: the required cloned repository content (including SampleCode.Rmd and README) is not present in the working directory tree, despite the task statement asserting it is. Additionally, the required runtime (R/Rscript) is absent, making the core task (rendering an Rmd via Rscript) mechanically impossible. These are infrastructure/setup deficiencies rather than agent skill issues. | causation_reasoning: Failure was caused by missing essential inputs/tools. Without SampleCode.Rmd there is nothing to render, and without R/Rscript the render command cannot be executed even if files existed. No alternative agent approach can overcome absence of both the repository artifacts and the R runtime within the sandbox constraints. | evidence: Directory listing shows no repo files: ""total 24 ... .config ... .gitconfig ... .bashrc ..."" and searches return nothing: ""find . -maxdepth 5 -type f -name 'SampleCode.Rmd'"" (no output) and ""find . -maxdepth 5 -type f -iname 'README*'"" (no output).

capsule-8536428,corebench,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The transcript shows a workable repository layout with the needed scripts and data present (e.g., Combined_Corpus training CSVs and the relevant NB ngram and KNN Empath scripts). The only hard failure shown is due to the agent misusing the sandboxed python_interpreter by importing a disallowed module (pathlib). This is a tooling constraint the agent could have avoided by using execute_bash (which was available and already used successfully). No evidence indicates missing files, permission denials, network blocks, harness errors, or other infrastructure defects that make the task mechanically impossible for any agent. | causation_reasoning: The run fails at the first attempt because python_interpreter forbids importing pathlib. This is not an environmental barrier under the rubric because the agent could have switched to execute_bash for filesystem inspection (and later did). The task was still feasible: required files were found, and there were no demonstrated impassable issues like missing dependencies that cannot be installed, lack of required system headers, or blocked paths. Thus the failure is attributable to agent approach/tool misuse, not infrastructure. | evidence: Failure point: ""Error: Code execution failed at line 'from pathlib import Path' due to: InterpreterError: Import from pathlib is not allowed. Authorized imports are: [...]"".

capsule-9137200,corebench,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The failure shown is due to the agent attempting to open the wrong README path (README.md at repository root) when the actual README is located under the code/ subdirectory. This is not an infrastructure defect like permission issues, missing required files from the benchmark, sandbox restrictions, or network blocks; the needed files (code/README.md, code/requirements.txt, code/PGAT/main.py) are present and accessible as shown by directory listing. | causation_reasoning: The run failed because the agent used an incorrect file path for README.md, triggering an error from inspect_file_as_text(). A different action (searching for README.md and using the correct path) would have succeeded, as demonstrated in the subsequent steps where the agent listed code/ and successfully read code/README.md and code/PGAT/main.py.

capsule-9832712,corebench,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: No clear infrastructure-level barrier is demonstrated. The run fails due to missing R package dependencies (e.g., tidyverse) and due to the agent using the wrong tool for file types (.R and .Rmd) that the provided inspect_file_as_text tool does not support. Both issues are generally solvable by an agent (install packages; use execute_bash to read .R/.Rmd; use alternative approaches). Nothing indicates a mechanically impossible condition like network prohibition for required downloads, permission denial, read-only FS, conda ToS block, missing system headers without workaround, or a harness crash. | causation_reasoning: The immediate failure point preventing completion is an agent-capability/process issue: the agent did not install required R packages before running the pipeline, and then attempted to use inspect_file_as_text on unsupported file extensions. These are not impassable environmental barriers; the agent could have installed R packages (e.g., install.packages('tidyverse')) and inspected .R/.Rmd via execute_bash (cat/sed/grep). | evidence: 1) R run failure due to missing package: ""Error in library(tidyverse) : there is no package called ‘tidyverse’"" when running ""cd code && Rscript master_script.R"".

capsule-9911222,corebench,1.00,0,"existence_reasoning: A benchmark/environment deficiency exists: the environment prevents installing required R dependencies (notably rmarkdown and numerous CRAN/Bioconductor packages) needed to render the vignette to PDF. The vignette rendering requirement is therefore mechanically impossible because the necessary packages are unavailable and the environment blocks the only standard installation path (downloading from CRAN/Bioconductor). This matches the rubric's environmental barrier indicator for network restrictions preventing required downloads. | causation_reasoning: This deficiency directly caused the run to fail: the agent could not install rmarkdown (render prerequisite) because repository access to CRAN was blocked, and could not use apt/sudo to install system-provided R packages. Without rmarkdown (and other dependencies), rmarkdown::render cannot run, so producing the required PDF output is impossible regardless of agent skill. | evidence: 1) Render hard-fails due to missing rmarkdown: ""Error in loadNamespace(x) : there is no package called ‘rmarkdown’"".
