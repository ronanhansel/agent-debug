The notebook was successfully executed and an HTML was written at least once, indicating the infrastructure and core evaluation path are functional. | causation_reasoning: Failure was driven by agent/tool misuse and path/IO handling errors, not an impassable barrier. The agent repeatedly assumed execute_bash returned a dict (it appears to return a plain string), causing indexing errors, and later used incorrect relative paths when reading the produced HTML (leading to 'Not a regular file'). These are recoverable with correct handling (use execute_bash directly, parse its returned string, ensure correct working directory and correct HTML path such as ../../results/FS-Filters.html after running in ./code). | evidence: 1) Notebook execution succeeded at one point: ""[NbConvertApp] Writing 509385 bytes to ../../results/FS-Filters.html"".

capsule-2345790,corebench,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The transcript shows no clear benchmark/environment infrastructure defect that makes the task mechanically impossible for any agent. The failure is a missing R package (rmarkdown) after the agent attempted installation, but there is no evidence of an impassable blocker such as network denial, Conda ToS errors, permission issues, missing system headers with no sudo, sandbox import bans, or harness errors. The run also shows R invoking a conda toolchain, suggesting package installation is generally possible in this environment. Therefore, no benchmark deficiency is established from the provided trace. | causation_reasoning: The failure was caused by the agent not successfully installing/confirming installation of the required R package 'rmarkdown' before attempting to render Rmds. This is an agent capability/process issue: the agent could have verified installation with `Rscript -e ""packageVersion('rmarkdown')""`, checked `.libPaths()`, installed to the correct library path, or installed via conda/apt as alternatives. Since viable alternative actions likely exist, the failure is not attributable to an unavoidable environmental barrier. | evidence: Rendering step fails for every Rmd: ""Error in loadNamespace(x) : there is no package called ‘rmarkdown’"" (repeated for all files). Earlier the agent attempted installation: `Rscript -e ""install.packages(c('rmarkdown', ...), repos='https://cran.rstudio.com/')""` but did not verify success; later `rmarkdown::render(...)` immediately errors due to missing package.",prop_DeepSeek-R1
capsule-3418007,corebench,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The transcript shows missing Python dependencies (xgboost, shap, imblearn) and a NumPy/SHAP incompatibility, but none of these are demonstrated to be impassable infrastructure barriers. These are typical environment/package-management issues that can generally be resolved by installing the correct packages/versions (e.g., pip install xgboost, pip install shap, pip install imbalanced-learn) and aligning versions (or using a different SHAP version / pure-Python fallback / avoiding SHAP-dependent path). There is no evidence of sandbox import bans, network prohibition preventing installs, lack of build headers with no workaround, permission/read-only issues, harness errors, or other mechanical impossibilities. | causation_reasoning: The run failed because the agent did not successfully install the needed dependencies in a compatible set. The errors are standard ModuleNotFoundError and version mismatch errors, which could be overcome by different installation choices (e.g., installing imbalanced-learn for imblearn, selecting SHAP version compatible with the platform's Python/NumPy, or modifying execution to skip SHAP-related plotting if not required for metric extraction). Therefore the failure is attributable to agent capability/package-resolution rather than an unavoidable environmental barrier. | evidence: Key failure points:
- ""ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'xgboost'"" when running code/feature_selection.py and utils.py.
- ""ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'shap'"" when running code/performance_measurement.py.
- After installing shap, NumPy compatibility error: ""A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in NumPy 2.3.5"" and later ""AttributeError: module 'numpy' has no attribute 'bool8'"".
- Missing imblearn: ""ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'imblearn'"".

capsule-3821950,corebench,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: No clear infrastructure/benchmark deficiency is evidenced. The only error shown is from the agent attempting to read a non-existent or non-regular file path (README.md at repo root). The repository does contain a README at code/README.md, indicating the environment and files are present and accessible when referenced correctly. | causation_reasoning: The run failed due to agent/tool misuse rather than an impassable barrier. The agent called inspect_file_as_text via python_interpreter (not needed) and targeted README.md in the wrong location, producing 'Not a regular file'. After discovering the correct path (code/README.md), the agent did not proceed with the actual task steps (create results/figures, render the Rmd with Rscript, parse outputs). Another agent could have corrected the path and continued; nothing indicates sandbox/network/permission/installation blocks that make the task mechanically impossible. | evidence: Failure point: ""Error: Code execution failed at line 'readme_content = inspect_file_as_text(""README.md"", ...) due to: PureError: Not a regular file"".

capsule-4252248,corebench,1.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The run environment lacks the required benchmark-provided input datasets. The README enumerates required files (e.g., DNF_pert_all.RData, ctrpv2_celldrug.csv, chembl_drugtargets-16_5-10-02.txt). The agent verified that the expected local Data directory is empty, and code inspection shows scripts load specific .RData inputs from Data/. Without these files, no agent can compute the requested PR AUC from CTRPv2 vs ATC/CHEMBL, because the core inputs are absent. | causation_reasoning: The missing data directly prevented generation of outputs/metrics. The agent confirmed Data/ is empty and later found main-network-generation.R calls load(""Data/ctrpv2-Integrated.RData""), which cannot succeed without that file. The agent also attempted to use Docker (as recommended by README) but Docker is unavailable in the environment; while this is another limitation, the primary blocking issue for the requested AUC is absent input data that should have been provided by the benchmark setup. As a result, the agent could not legitimately extract the AUC and resorted to guessing, causing failure. | evidence: 1) Data not present: `Stdout:\ntotal 0` from `ls -l Data`.
2) Script requires missing input: in `main-network-generation.R`: `load(""Data/ctrpv2-Integrated.RData"")`.
3) README lists required data files: `The script will be using data files such as: - `/data/DNF_pert_all.RData` ... - `/data/ctrpv2_celldrug.csv` ... - `/data/chembl_drugtargets-16_5-10-02.txt``.

capsule-5136217,corebench,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: No clear benchmark/infrastructure deficiency is demonstrated. The only concrete failure shown is the agent attempting to open a non-existent/incorrect README path (README.md) and getting an error. The benchmark does appear to provide a Readme file (./code/Readme.txt), so required information was available. There are no signs of sandbox restrictions, missing headers, permission denials, network blocks, harness errors, or container crashes in the provided trace. | causation_reasoning: The run fails due to agent mistakes in tool usage and workflow, not an impassable environmental barrier. The agent called inspect_file_as_text(""README.md"") and received 'PureError: Not a regular file', then repeatedly misused tools (calling execute_bash via python_interpreter) and never actually proceeded to install dependencies or run the R scripts in a validated way. Since the correct Readme exists at ./code/Readme.txt and the agent successfully found it with find, an alternative (and correct) approach was available to complete the task. | evidence: Key failure: ""Error: Code execution failed at line 'readme_content = inspect_file_as_text(\""README.md\"")' due to: PureError: Not a regular file"". Evidence that required info exists elsewhere: `find . -iname ""*readme*""` returned ""./code/Readme.txt"". Also shows agent/tool misuse: tool calls show python_interpreter invoked with execute_bash(...) strings (e.g., ""Calling tools: ... 'name': 'python_interpreter', 'arguments': 'execute_bash(\""ls -l | grep -i readme\"")'""), indicating incorrect execution strategy rather than an infrastructure block.",prop_DeepSeek-R1
capsule-7186268,corebench,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The transcript shows a missing dependency (the R package `rmarkdown`) at runtime, but there is no evidence this is an impassable infrastructure defect. The environment allows installing R packages from CRAN (e.g., `remotes` installed successfully) and from GitHub (`remotes::install_github(""DHLab-TSENG/lab"")` began installing numerous CRAN dependencies and compiling code), indicating network access and write permissions to R libraries exist. The README also did not enumerate all dependencies needed to render an Rmd (it only mentioned `remotes` for installing the `lab` package), but missing `rmarkdown` is a common solvable dependency issue rather than a benchmark/harness defect. No container crash, permission denial, ToS block, missing system headers, or sandbox restriction is shown. | causation_reasoning: The run failed because the agent attempted to render the Rmd before installing `rmarkdown` (and likely `knitr`). This is a dependency-management/tooling sequencing issue the agent could have overcome by installing `rmarkdown` (and its dependencies) properly and verifying `library(rmarkdown)` loads, or by using an alternate installation path (`install.packages(..., lib=...)`, setting `R_LIBS_USER`, or using conda to install `r-rmarkdown`). Since CRAN downloads worked for `remotes`, the environment was not fundamentally blocking installations. Therefore the failure is attributable to agent approach rather than an environmental barrier. | evidence: Failure point: ""Error in loadNamespace(x) : there is no package called ‘rmarkdown’\nCalls: loadNamespace -> withRestarts -> withOneRestart -> doWithOneRestart\nExecution halted"" when running ""Rscript -e \""rmarkdown::render('SampleCode.Rmd', output_dir='../results', params = list(clean = TRUE))\"""".

capsule-8536428,corebench,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The run shows multiple benchmark/repo deficiencies: (1) hardcoded absolute data paths pointing to /data/... instead of the provided repository data/ directory; (2) code uses a deprecated pandas API signature (DataFrame.drop with positional axis argument) incompatible with the environment's pandas; (3) the k-NN empath script expects a specific feature CSV that is not present under the repository's data directory structure as referenced. These are repository/packaging issues rather than an agent strategy issue because they prevent straightforward execution of the provided training scripts as-is. | causation_reasoning: These deficiencies directly caused the failure: initial execution failed due to FileNotFoundError from hardcoded /data paths. After path edits, the NB script still failed due to the pandas drop() signature mismatch (TypeError), preventing metrics computation. The k-NN empath run still failed because the expected empath feature CSV path did not exist in the provided data. Because both target scripts could not run to completion, the agent could not obtain the required metrics. While a skilled agent might patch code and/or regenerate empath features, the transcript ends with the scripts still failing due to these repo/data issues, so the deficiency caused this run's failure. | evidence: Hardcoded path missing: ""FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/data/Combined_Corpus/Train/fulltrain_Guardian_Nyt_binary_shuffled_clean.csv'"" and similarly for empath: ""No such file or directory: '/data/Combined_Corpus/Train/empath feature/Empath_fulltrain_Guardian_Nyt_binary_shuffled_feature.csv'"".

capsule-9137200,corebench,1.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The benchmark setup is missing essential assets required to run the provided test command: (a) it expects a saved model checkpoint at an absolute path under /data/cache/variable/bert/..., and (b) it expects external datasets/embeddings that are not included. Additionally, the README pins very old dependencies (Python 3.8, torch 1.7.1, transformers 4.2.1) that are not mechanically installable in the provided runtime (Python 3.11) without a working way to switch interpreters/environments, and tokenizers==0.9.4 requires building native code that failed in this environment. These are infrastructure/benchmark formation deficiencies because the run cannot be completed as specified without missing files and without feasible installation of required versions. | causation_reasoning: The run fails before producing metrics because the required checkpoint file is absent at a hardcoded location, which blocks any agent from proceeding to evaluation output. Separately, the environment prevents installing the README-pinned torch/tokenizers stack (torch==1.7.1 not available for this Python; tokenizers build fails), which also blocks faithful reproduction. While the agent made some mistakes (e.g., trying docker, attempting to wget Baidu links), the decisive failure in the transcript is the missing checkpoint file at /data/cache/variable/bert/resume, which is an impassable missing-asset condition in this sandbox (no network access for Baidu downloads; file not provided). | evidence: 1) Missing checkpoint file prevents test run: ""FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/data/cache/variable/bert/resume'"".

None of the logged errors indicate an impassable infrastructure defect such as network blockade, read-only FS, missing system headers without sudo, conda ToS block, sandbox import restriction, or harness failure. The repository appears intact (code/master_script.R exists; code subfolders exist; data files are present). | causation_reasoning: Failure is attributable to agent capability/tooling mistakes rather than an environmental barrier. The agent did not successfully install/verify tidyverse (it tried install.packages, then conda install, but never validated installation properly), and repeatedly mis-handled tool return values (treating execute_bash output as an object with .stdout/.exit_code rather than a string), causing exceptions that halted progress. Additionally, the agent attempted to use inspect_file_as_text on a .Rmd file despite the tool explicitly not supporting .Rmd, which is avoidable by using execute_bash('cat ...') correctly and parsing the returned string.

capsule-9911222,corebench,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: No clear benchmark/infrastructure deficiency is demonstrated. The environment provides Rscript (R 4.2.3) and allows command execution. Failures stem from missing R packages and incorrect assumptions about filesystem/tool return types, which are typically resolvable by installing the needed packages (e.g., rmarkdown) using an available method (apt/pip/R install) or by troubleshooting library paths. Docker absence is not necessarily a benchmark deficiency because the task explicitly requires rendering via Rscript, not via Docker, and the README's Docker suggestion is optional guidance for running the Shiny app rather than proof that only Docker can satisfy the vignette rendering task. | causation_reasoning: The run failed because (1) the agent attempted to use Docker even though docker is unavailable, and (2) local rendering failed due to missing R package 'rmarkdown'. These are not shown to be mechanically impossible: the agent could have installed rmarkdown via alternative means (e.g., ensuring CRAN access/using apt to install r-cran-rmarkdown if networked package installs are restricted, checking R library paths, or using a provided renv/requirements file if present). Additionally, the agent made capability errors (treating execute_bash output as a dict, wrong Rmd path initially, and code-parsing/indentation mistakes) that prevented progress.
