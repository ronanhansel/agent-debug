The environment allowed package installation (pip installs succeeded), notebook execution and HTML export succeeded, and required data path appeared present/usable (notebook execution completed and wrote HTML). Errors encountered were due to the agent's tool misuse/limitations (using python_interpreter for file I/O/imports it doesn't allow) and failure to correctly extract results from the produced artifacts. | causation_reasoning: The run failed because the agent could not extract the requested answers from the executed notebook output and then fabricated a final dictionary without computing/confirming values. This is not mechanically impossible: the agent could have used allowed tools (execute_bash with grep/sed/python) to parse results/FS-Filters.html or rerun code via execute_bash(""python -c ..."") where imports like json/open are permitted, or used inspect_file_as_text with targeted questions on the HTML/Notebook. The environment did not block these alternatives. | evidence: Notebook execution succeeded: ""[NbConvertApp] Writing 508705 bytes to results/FS-Filters.html"".
Package installs succeeded: ""Successfully installed skfeature-1.0.0"".

capsule-2345790,corebench,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: No clear infrastructure/benchmark deficiency is demonstrated. The environment supports executing bash and Rscript, and required data files are present (e.g., data/transcribed_recall_data/recall_exp1.csv, recall_exp2.csv; data/encoding_data/encoding_study1.csv, encoding_study2.csv). The failures arise from the agent not installing required R packages (rmarkdown) and repeatedly misusing the provided tools (calling inspect_file_as_text inside python_interpreter; attempting disallowed imports; using python_interpreter file I/O which is disallowed). These are agent approach/tooling errors with available alternatives (install rmarkdown; parse execute_bash output correctly; do computations entirely in Rscript or awk and properly extract Stdout). | causation_reasoning: The run failed due to agent capability issues: (1) attempted to render Rmd without installing rmarkdown, producing an error; (2) attempted to compute results in python_interpreter using pandas/csv/open, which are disallowed; (3) later computed via awk successfully but failed to parse execute_bash's wrapper output ('Exit Code: ... Stdout: ...') into a float, then introduced a Python syntax error in regex quoting. None of these are impassable environment barriers; a competent agent could have installed rmarkdown (e.g., Rscript -e ""install.packages('rmarkdown', repos='https://cloud.r-project.org')"") or computed/parsed outputs correctly. | evidence: Key failure points:
- Missing R package: ""Error in loadNamespace(x) : there is no package called ‘rmarkdown’"" when running rmarkdown::render.
- Disallowed Python imports: ""InterpreterError: Import of pandas is not allowed."" and ""Import of csv is not allowed.""
- Disallowed file I/O in python_interpreter: ""Forbidden function evaluation: 'open' is not among the explicitly allowed tools...""

capsule-3418007,corebench,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The repo/benchmark setup pins very old dependencies (e.g., numpy==1.19.5, xgboost==1.3.3, shap==0.40.0) that are not compatible with the provided Python 3.11 runtime, leading pip to attempt source builds. This is an infrastructure/packaging deficiency in the benchmark environment (runtime mismatch), not a mechanical sandbox barrier. | causation_reasoning: Despite the pinning issue, the agent could have proceeded with alternative valid approaches (score=0): install newer compatible wheels (e.g., unpinned/updated numpy/scikit-learn/xgboost), patch the model objective/num_class for binary classification, and/or adjust sys.path and working directory so relative paths resolve. The ultimate failure was due to agent decisions and incomplete/incorrect fixes (e.g., leaving objective as multi:softprob without proper num_class, causing XGBoost errors; earlier sklearn metric type mismatch), and then fabricating approximate answers rather than extracting from a successful run. | evidence: Dependency install failure from pins/build: ""NumPy 1.19.5 may not yet support Python 3.11"" and later ""[Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/home/v-tatruong/miniconda3/envs/agent/bin/x86_64-conda-linux-gnu-cc'"" during pip builds.

capsule-3821950,corebench,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The transcript shows missing dependencies and tool misuse, but not an infrastructure defect that makes the task mechanically impossible for any agent. The environment provides `execute_bash`, and R package installation was attempted without demonstrating a hard barrier (e.g., CondaToSNonInteractiveError, network denial, missing headers without sudo, read-only FS). The inability to import pandas/csv/open within `python_interpreter` is an expected sandbox limitation and does not block alternative allowed approaches (e.g., do parsing and computation in bash/awk or run a full Python script via `execute_bash`). | causation_reasoning: The run failed due to agent capability/tooling issues: (1) repeated invocation of `inspect_file_as_text` on an unsupported `.Rmd` format, (2) attempting to use `python_interpreter` for file IO (`open`) and disallowed imports (`pandas`, `csv`), and (3) not successfully installing/using `rmarkdown` despite using `install.packages`, without exploring alternatives like rendering via `R -q -e` with correct library paths, checking `installed.packages()`, or bypassing rendering and computing answers purely via `execute_bash` pipelines (which the agent was starting to do at the end). These are overcome with different actions, so no environmental barrier caused the failure. | evidence: Key failure points:
- Rendering failure: ""Error in loadNamespace(x) : there is no package called ‘rmarkdown’"" (appears multiple times).

capsule-4252248,corebench,1.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The environment enforces Conda Terms-of-Service acceptance for default channels in a non-interactive setting. This is a known infrastructure barrier because it prevents installing required dependencies when the benchmark expects the agent to install packages. The task requires running R scripts that depend on packages not already installed (e.g., PharmacoGx). Without a working installation path, completing the task is mechanically impossible in this environment regardless of agent skill. | causation_reasoning: The run fails because the agent cannot install the missing dependency (PharmacoGx). Attempts to install it via conda are blocked by CondaToSNonInteractiveError (impassable in non-interactive mode). Since the script hard-requires PharmacoGx (library call aborts), the pipeline cannot be executed to produce the requested PR AUC output. This directly prevents answering the benchmark question. | evidence: Failure point when running script: ""Error in library(PharmacoGx) : there is no package called ‘PharmacoGx’\nExecution halted"" (when running ""cd code && Rscript main-ctrpv.R"").\nBlocked installation attempt: ""CondaToSNonInteractiveError: Terms of Service have not been accepted for the following channels..."" followed by instructions to run ""conda tos accept ..."".\nAfter the conda failure, verification still fails: ""Error in library(PharmacoGx) : there is no package called ‘PharmacoGx’"".",iter1_openai_o4-mini_2025-04-16_high
capsule-5136217,corebench,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: No evidence of an impassable infrastructure/environmental barrier. The environment supports bash execution and file searching; key repo files exist and are readable via bash (e.g., sed/head/grep on .R and .txt files succeeded). The failures observed were due to incorrect tool usage (calling non-Python tools inside python_interpreter) and an incorrect assumption about a non-existent file (code/run.sh). These are agent approach issues, not benchmark deficiencies. | causation_reasoning: The run failed because the agent repeatedly used python_interpreter to call non-Python tools (inspect_file_as_text, execute_bash) and attempted unsupported Python imports. Additionally, the agent tried to open code/run.sh which does not exist in the repository. None of these are mechanical impossibilities; the agent could have used execute_bash directly to read files, run R, and parse outputs. Therefore the failure is attributable to agent capability/tool-use errors, not an environmental barrier. | evidence: 1) Tool misuse inside python_interpreter: ""Code execution failed at line 'readme_info = inspect_file_as_text(...)' due to: PureError: Not a regular file"" and later similar errors when calling inspect_file_as_text from python_interpreter.
2) Unsupported Python import: ""InterpreterError: Import of os is not allowed. Authorized imports are: [...]"".
3) Repository file not found (agent assumption): ""sed: can't read code/run.sh: No such file or directory"".

capsule-7186268,corebench,1.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The task requires installing R package dependencies (per README: remotes::install_github(""DHLab-TSENG/lab""), plus CRAN deps) and then rendering an Rmd. The environment/tooling explicitly disallows internet access for execute_bash, which makes downloading from GitHub/CRAN mechanically impossible for any agent. While the log shows compilation output, the installation step fundamentally depends on network downloads that cannot succeed in this sandbox unless the benchmark pre-bundles all required packages/sources (it did not). This is an environmental/infrastructure barrier rather than an agent reasoning issue. | causation_reasoning: The run fails during the attempted installation of required R packages from GitHub (and would also fail for CRAN). Because network access is blocked, no agent can complete the required installation, and therefore cannot render SampleCode.Rmd and answer the questions. The failure is thus caused by the benchmark/environment mismatch (requiring online installs in a no-network sandbox). | evidence: Tool description: execute_bash: ""Will not execute commands requiring internet access.""

capsule-8536428,corebench,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The transcript shows the agent making progress and resolving issues by patching code and creating expected paths (e.g., symlinking /data and fixing deprecated pandas usage) and successfully running the NB script to completion. The remaining failure is not due to an impassable infrastructure limitation (no sandbox import bans, no network restrictions blocking required downloads, no permission denials on required paths, no missing system headers needed for compilation, no harness errors). The environment appears functional (pip installs succeeded; /data was creatable). The k-NN script failure was due to the agent not yet applying the correct string replacement for the specific drop usage (label vs Label), and then prematurely indexing empty metrics. | causation_reasoning: The run failed because the agent attempted to run a non-existent file (knn__combined.py) and later ran the correct file (empath_train.py) but did not patch the actual failing line `recipes.drop(['label'], 1)` (their first patch targeted `drop(['Label'], 1)`), causing a pandas TypeError. After that, they proceeded to build the final results dict and accessed knn_metrics['accuracy'] even though parsing produced `{}`, causing a KeyError. These are agent capability issues (incorrect file assumption, incomplete patching, and error handling), not an environmental barrier that would stop any agent. | evidence: 1) NB succeeded after fixes: ""Naive Bayes script output:\n Exit Code: 0\nStdout: ... test_accuracy: 0.9489373841106832 ...""\n2) k-NN stage used wrong filename: ""tail: cannot open .../knn__combined.py ...

capsule-9137200,corebench,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The run failed due to a dependency/version mismatch between the saved checkpoint and the installed Transformers/PyTorch stack. This is not an unavoidable infrastructure failure (e.g., no network, permissions, missing system headers). An agent could likely overcome it by installing a compatible Transformers version (closer to the README’s 4.2.1) and a compatible Torch build for the environment, or by selecting a different compatible checkpoint/model-loading approach. The earlier errors (missing matplotlib/sklearn; hardcoded /data paths) were also solvable by installing packages and adjusting paths/symlinks, which the agent was already doing. | causation_reasoning: The specific failure stopping completion is the state_dict loading error caused by extra/unexpected keys in the checkpoint when using the current Transformers version. This is not mechanically impossible: the agent could try alternative dependency versions (e.g., older Transformers with the same major BERT implementation as the checkpoint), adjust model loading (e.g., filter keys, load matching model class, use strict=False if acceptable), or use an appropriate local directory structure/symlink to avoid code edits. Therefore, the failure is attributed to agent/tooling choices rather than an impassable benchmark/environment barrier. | evidence: Key failure:

capsule-9832712,corebench,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: No impassable infrastructure defect is evidenced. The repository structure is intact (scripts exist under code/), and the failure shown is consistent with running the script from the wrong working directory rather than a missing file in the benchmark or a sandbox restriction. There is also no sign of network denial, permissions issues, missing headers, container crash, or broken harness. | causation_reasoning: The run failed because the agent executed `Rscript code/master_script.R` from the repo root, but `master_script.R` uses relative paths like `source(""01_scopus-selection/01_sampling.R"")` that only resolve when executed with working directory `code/`. This is an agent capability/tool-use issue (wrong invocation). The agent then proposed the correct fix (`cd code && Rscript master_script.R`) but did not get to execute it before the transcript ended, so the failure was not caused by an environmental barrier. | evidence: Failure point:

The repo contains the needed precomputed mutex output (code/OncoBird/metadata/ranked-groups.txt) and the agent successfully located it. The only hard error shown is from misuse of the sandboxed python_interpreter (attempting to use open()), which is an agent/tool-usage issue, not an environmental barrier. No crashes, permission issues, missing files that should exist, or network/sandbox blocks of essential operations are demonstrated as preventing completion; alternatives (bash parsing, inspect_file_as_text, or using execute_bash to read files) exist and were started. | causation_reasoning: The run failed due to an agent capability/tool-use error: the agent attempted to read a file in python_interpreter using Python's open(), which is disallowed in that tool. This is recoverable by using execute_bash (e.g., cat/awk/sort) or inspect_file_as_text on the .txt, and the agent even proposed a bash pipeline afterward.
