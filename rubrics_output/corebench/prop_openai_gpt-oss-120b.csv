The repository contents are present and listable (code/, data/, etc.), and there is no indication of missing files, permission issues, network restrictions, sandbox import blocks, or harness failures. The only encountered error was from using an incorrect path (attempting to open README.md at repo root when it exists under ./code). | causation_reasoning: The run failed due to an agent capability issue: it attempted to read README.md from the wrong location and misused the toolchain (calling inspect_file_as_text inside python_interpreter, and later using file_content_search similarly). This is recoverable by a competent agent by first locating the README (e.g., ./code/README.md) and then proceeding with installs and Rmd rendering. Nothing in the transcript shows an environmental barrier that would block any agent. | evidence: Failure point: ""Error: Code execution failed at line 'readme_content = inspect_file_as_text(file_path=\""README.md\"", question=\""\"")' due to: PureError: Not a regular file"". Subsequent repository listing shows README is not at root but at ""./code/README.md"" (""./code:\n...\nREADME.md\n..."").

capsule-3821950,corebench,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The transcript shows the environment is functioning: directory listing succeeded and the expected repository structure (code/, data/, results/) is present. There is no evidence of an infrastructure defect such as permission errors, sandbox import blocks, missing required benchmark files, network restrictions preventing required downloads, or harness/tool failures. | causation_reasoning: Failure occurred because the agent did not proceed past an initial ls command and then made a nonsensical empty python_interpreter tool call. No attempt was made to read README.md, install dependencies, create results/figures, or render the Rmd. This is an agent execution/plan-follow-through issue, not an impassable environmental barrier. | evidence: Successful environment interaction: ""Exit Code: 0"" and repo tree includes ""./code/README.md"" and ""./code/ktc_11_paper.Rmd"" plus ""results"" directory.

capsule-4252248,corebench,1.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The run failed before any repository interaction due to an infrastructure/harness parsing constraint: the environment expects tool calls to be embedded in a specific code-fence format matched by a regex, and rejected a valid-looking tool invocation because it was not wrapped in the required pattern. This is not a solvable-in-task programming or reasoning issue about the target repo; it is a benchmark/harness I/O formatting requirement that mechanically blocks execution when not satisfied. | causation_reasoning: The failure occurred at the first attempted tool call (`execute_bash(""ls -R ."")`). The harness rejected the snippet with a regex error, preventing any further progress (no files listed, no README read, no scripts run). Therefore the harness deficiency directly caused the run to fail. | evidence: Error message: ""Error in code parsing: Your code snippet is invalid, because the regex pattern ```(?:py|python)?\s*\n(.*?)\n``` was not found in it.""

capsule-5136217,corebench,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: No evidence of an impassable infrastructure/benchmark defect is shown. The environment appears functional: commands execute, repository contents are accessible, and a Readme file is present (as Readme.txt). The only issue observed is the agent's incorrect method for locating the README. | causation_reasoning: The run failed due to an agent capability/tool-use mistake: the agent used file_content_search(""README""), which searches within file contents, not filenames, then concluded no README existed. However, a repository listing clearly shows ./code/Readme.txt. The task could have proceeded by directly inspecting ./code/Readme.txt and then running the required R scripts. No environmental barrier prevented completion. | evidence: Agent result: ""Search result for README files: No matches found for 'README' in 28 files.\nNo README file detected.""

capsule-7186268,corebench,1.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The run fails before any repository inspection or R execution due to the harness rejecting tool calls with a code-parsing regex error. This indicates broken evaluation/tooling infrastructure: the environment cannot accept a valid execute_bash invocation and instead requires an unrelated markdown ```py code``` pattern, preventing any agent from using the provided tools to proceed. | causation_reasoning: The agent’s attempt to run a basic command (`ls -R .`) via execute_bash was blocked by the harness with a parsing error, and subsequent retries produced the same error. Since the agent cannot execute shell commands or meaningfully use tools, it is mechanically impossible to complete the task (install packages, run Rscript, render HTML, extract answers). Thus the benchmark/tooling deficiency directly caused the failure. | evidence: Failure message: ""Error in code parsing: Your code snippet is invalid, because the regex pattern ```(?:py|python)?\s*\n(.*?)\n``` was not found in it."" shown after the agent attempted `execute_bash` with `ls -R .`.

capsule-8536428,corebench,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: No evidence of an infrastructure/benchmark deficiency (e.g., permissions, missing files, sandbox import blocks, network, crashes) appears in the transcript. The only observed issue is the agent failing to correctly format a tool call according to the harness-required code pattern, which is an agent usage error rather than an environmental barrier. | causation_reasoning: The run failed because the agent did not successfully invoke any repository-reading or execution tools. The harness error indicates malformed code/tool invocation formatting, which the agent could have corrected by making a proper inspect_file_as_text(""README.md"", ...) call or by using execute_bash to list files. Therefore, the failure is attributable to agent capability/tool-use, not an impassable environment limitation. | evidence: User-side tool parser error: ""Error in code parsing: Your code snippet is invalid, because the regex pattern `(?:py|python)?\s*\n(.*?)\n` was not found in it."" followed by guidance to include:

capsule-9137200,corebench,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The failure arises from a code/config mismatch in how the script references a local BERT model path, not from an impassable infrastructure limitation (e.g., no network, permissions, missing system libs). The repository actually contains a local model at ./data/bert-base-chinese, so the environment appears to provide the needed artifact; the script is just pointing to /data/bert-base-chinese (absolute path) which is not valid in this runtime layout. This is solvable by changing working directory, adjusting a path, or providing the expected path via symlink/setting, which is within agent control and does not require privileged operations. | causation_reasoning: The immediate cause of failure is the HuggingFace Transformers loader rejecting the absolute path '/data/bert-base-chinese/' as an invalid repo id in the installed transformers/huggingface_hub version. An agent could overcome this by running from the correct directory, patching TrainModel.py to use the correct relative path (e.g., ./data/bert-base-chinese), or creating a symlink so /data/bert-base-chinese exists and contains the model. Therefore, this is not mechanically impossible for all agents; it is an agent/repo configuration issue rather than an environmental barrier. | evidence: Traceback shows: ""self.bert_encoder = BertModel.from_pretrained('/data/bert-base-chinese/')"" followed by ""HFValidationError: Repo id must be in the form 'repo_name' or 'namespace/repo_name': '/data/bert-base-chinese/'.""

The run fails before any repository execution due to the agent producing an invalid tool-call format. | causation_reasoning: Failure was caused by an agent/tool-use formatting error: the agent attempted to call `file_content_search` but produced a malformed snippet that the harness could not parse.

Tools functioned and the README content was successfully retrieved, indicating the environment was operational. | causation_reasoning: The run failed due to agent/tool misuse and premature termination before attempting the required steps (install dependencies, render Rmd, parse PDF). The agent attempted to call inspect_file_as_text from within python_interpreter, which is a tool-usage error and avoidable with correct tool invocation (call inspect_file_as_text directly, then use execute_bash for Rscript rendering). This is an agent capability issue, not an environmental barrier. | evidence: Agent states confusion about tool usage: ""We need to call inspect_file_as_text...
