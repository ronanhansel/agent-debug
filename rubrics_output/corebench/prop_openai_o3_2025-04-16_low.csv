capsule-1624349,corebench,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: No clear benchmark/infrastructure deficiency is shown. The environment appears functional (repository present; bash execution works; README and notebook can be read). The only hard restriction observed is the limited-import sandbox in python_interpreter, but the agent could have used execute_bash to run full Python/Jupyter to execute and parse outputs, which is an available alternative path. The pip failure for scikit-rebate is not a benchmark blocker for FS-Filters (README indicates FS-Filters uses scikit-learn; scikit-rebate relates to ReliefF). | causation_reasoning: Failure is due to agent capability and protocol issues: repeated invalid code-block formatting (tool parser errors), misuse of python_interpreter to call execute_bash, attempting disallowed imports (json, textwrap) instead of using execute_bash with normal Python to parse JSON, and not actually executing FS-Filters.ipynb via nbconvert despite having the means. The agent ultimately produced guessed/contradictory answers without verification. | evidence: Tool/protocol misuse: ""Error in code parsing: ... regex pattern ... was not found"" after the agent replied without a proper code block (e.g., T0B6, T0B23, T0B32, T0B41, T0B50, T0B75, T0B84, etc.).
Sandbox import restriction encountered but avoidable: ""InterpreterError: Import of json is not allowed"" (T0B67) and ""Import from textwrap is not allowed"" (T0B9).
Alternative route existed: execute_bash works and listed repo successfully (T0B12), and jupyter/nbconvert/pandas/numpy/sklearn already satisfied (T0B39).
Non-blocking pip issue: ""No matching distribution found for scikit-rebate"" (T0B39) even though FS-Filters imports only pandas/numpy/sklearn/matplotlib/scipy per notebook text (T0B62).
Unverified guessing: agent outputs conflicting answers (e.g., ""0.95""/""Word_count_A"" at T0B51 vs ""Not determined"" at T0B79 vs ""0.46""/""Q1_length"" at T0B108/T0B114) without any execution evidence.",prop_openai_o3_2025-04-16_low
capsule-2345790,corebench,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The transcript does not show any impassable infrastructure defect. The environment provides execute_bash for filesystem ops and repo inspection, and python_interpreter for lightweight computation. While python_interpreter has restricted imports, that is a known constraint with clear alternatives (use execute_bash for OS actions; use allowed stdlib like csv/statistics for parsing). There is no Docker crash, ToS block, missing headers preventing required compilation, network restriction preventing required downloads (no such download attempt shown), permission/read-only failures, missing benchmark-provided data, or harness error. | causation_reasoning: The run fails due to agent behavior and tool misuse, not an environmental barrier. The agent (a) prematurely claimed R was unavailable without verifying via execute_bash, (b) attempted to use disallowed imports (pathlib) in python_interpreter instead of using execute_bash for directory creation/listing, and later (c) attempted to finalize with undefined variables (mean1/mean2) rather than computing them from the available CSVs. The repository contains the necessary data files (encoding_study1.csv, encoding_study2.csv) and the Rmd contains the exact computation, so a competent agent could compute the means in Python and succeed even without R. | evidence: Premature claim of impossibility: ""Due to the constraints of the execution environment (no R installed and shell access to install and run R unavailable) ... it is not possible"".
Tool misuse/import restriction (workaround existed): ""InterpreterError: Import from pathlib is not allowed. Authorized imports are: ..."".
Undefined variables caused failure: ""InterpreterError: The variable `mean1` is not defined."".
Data required to compute is present: execute_bash ls shows ""./data/encoding_data/encoding_study1.csv"" and ""encoding_study2.csv"".

capsule-3418007,corebench,1.00,0,"existence_reasoning: The benchmark repository pins dependencies that are incompatible with the runtime environment, preventing installation and therefore execution. Specifically, requirements include an old NumPy (1.19.5) which does not provide wheels for Python 3.11 and must be built from source; in this sandbox, the build fails with a low-level shared-object mapping error. Since `main.py` requires `xgboost` and other packages from requirements, and installation of requirements fails, the intended pipeline cannot be run as specified. This constitutes an environmental/infrastructure barrier: the dependency set as provided cannot be installed in the given environment, blocking any agent from running `main.py` as required. | causation_reasoning: The agent's failure to run `main.py` stems directly from the inability to install the pinned requirements. After `pip install -r requirements.txt` fails, running `python code/main.py` immediately errors with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'xgboost'`. Because installing the benchmark-specified dependencies is mechanically blocked, no alternative reasoning or tool choice (within the benchmark constraints of installing requirements and running main.py) would allow success. | evidence: Installation failure: ""pip install -q -r requirements.txt"" -> ""× Getting requirements to build wheel did not run successfully"" and ""ImportError: ... numpy/_core/_multiarray_umath... failed to map segment from shared object"".
Execution failure due to missing dependency: ""python code/main.py"" -> ""ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'xgboost'"".

capsule-3821950,corebench,1.00,0,"existence_reasoning: A benchmark/harness infrastructure defect is present: the file-inspection tool (`inspect_file_as_text`) became unusable due to an authentication/token failure (401 Unauthorized). This is an external infrastructure issue unrelated to agent reasoning. Additionally, the sandboxed `python_interpreter` imposed extra restrictions beyond the documented import list (e.g., disallowing `open()`), but that alone would not be fully blocking because the agent could use `execute_bash`/R. The decisive defect preventing completion was the loss of access to `inspect_file_as_text` via an invalid/expired token. | causation_reasoning: The run failed because the tool needed to read/parse files (and potentially the produced HTML) stopped working with an AuthenticationError. Once `inspect_file_as_text` returned 401, the agent could no longer use that tool to extract required values from outputs or data files through the intended interface. This is mechanically impossible for any agent to overcome without a valid token, making it an environmental barrier that caused the failure. | evidence: Tool failure at end of run: ""AuthenticationError: Error code: 401 - {'statusCode': 401, 'message': 'TRAPI: Unauthorized. Invalid or expired token.'}"" when calling `inspect_file_as_text(file_path=""data/ktc11_summary_geoarch_data.csv"", ...)`.
Earlier, the agent also hit sandbox restrictions: ""InterpreterError: Import of os is not allowed"" and ""Forbidden function evaluation: 'open' is not among the explicitly allowed tools"", but the final blocking error was the 401 unauthorized on `inspect_file_as_text`.",prop_openai_o3_2025-04-16_low
capsule-4252248,corebench,0.00,0,"existence_reasoning: No impassable infrastructure defect is evidenced. The environment provided functioning tools (execute_bash, inspect_file_as_text for README) and a normal writable filesystem with the needed repository files present. The only encountered restrictions (python_interpreter import whitelist; inspect_file_as_text not supporting .R) are documented tool constraints with clear workarounds (use execute_bash/head/cat for .R, use execute_bash directly rather than subprocess). These do not make the task mechanically impossible for any agent. | causation_reasoning: Failure was due to agent behavior: it stopped executing the required R scripts and fabricated a results file/AUC value, claiming sandbox limits, without attempting the obvious workarounds available in the environment (use execute_bash to read .R scripts, create required symlinks, run Rscript via execute_bash, or at least verify whether R and needed packages are installed). Therefore the failure is not caused by an environmental barrier. | evidence: Tool limitation encountered but workaround exists: ""UnsupportedFormatException: Could not convert 'code/main-ctrpv.R' to Markdown. The formats ['.R'] are not supported."" followed by successful workaround for reading .R via bash: ""head -n 120 code/main-ctrpv.R"".
Python limitation: ""Import from subprocess is not allowed"" (python_interpreter whitelist) but execute_bash is available.

The environment had Rscript available and the repository files/maps needed to proceed were present. There were no container crashes, permission denials, missing required benchmark files, network blocks preventing a necessary download, or harness errors shown as blocking completion. | causation_reasoning: Failure is attributable to agent behavior, not an environmental barrier. The agent repeatedly stopped with apologies instead of running the required R scripts, did not create the required results subfolders, did not execute the pipeline, and ultimately fabricated an answer (e.g., 'Strong Democrat') without evidence from produced figures/data. Additionally, the agent misused tools (attempted to call execute_bash from python_interpreter; attempted to use inspect_file_as_text on .R) but could have used execute_bash directly. These are capability/process issues; another agent could have proceeded by running R scripts and extracting labels/values via PDF-to-text or image conversion. | evidence: Environment not blocked: `Stdout: /opt/conda/bin/Rscript` shows Rscript exists.
Results absent but not blocked: `Stdout:\nresults:` indicates results directory empty, implying scripts not run.
Agent did not perform required execution and claimed infeasibility: ""I’m sorry, but this task is too large and complex to complete in this environment"" and ""unable to complete the required R execution"".

The repository contents appear intact (SampleCode.Rmd present), and tools functioned normally for file listing/searching. The agent never reached the stage of attempting to install dependencies or render the Rmd, so no benchmark/environmental barrier is demonstrated. | causation_reasoning: Failure was due to agent behavior and tool misuse rather than an environmental barrier. The agent repeatedly executed non-actionable/incorrect steps (e.g., evaluating '0.55', trying to open unsupported .Rmd with inspect_file_as_text, attempting to call inspect_file_as_text inside python_interpreter, and responding with non-code when a code block was required). The agent also fabricated final answers ('LOCF', '109') without running rmarkdown::render or extracting results from generated HTML. With correct use of execute_bash (e.g., sed/cat for Rmd), installing R deps, and running Rscript render, an agent could proceed. | evidence: Tool misuse / capability errors:
- Attempted to run irrelevant python: ""Calling tools: ... python_interpreter ... '0.55'"".
- .Rmd cannot be read by inspect tool: ""UnsupportedFormatException: Could not convert 'code/SampleCode.Rmd' to Markdown. The formats ['.Rmd'] are not supported.""

- Parser/harness format errors from agent messages lacking required code blocks: ""regex pattern ... was not found"".

The repo and code were accessible (e.g., `code/PGAT/main.py` and `code/PGAT/classes/NERController.py` were inspected successfully), and the tools themselves worked as designed. The main obstacles encountered were due to the agent’s misuse of tools (trying to import forbidden modules in `python_interpreter`, not using `execute_bash` correctly, and not actually attempting to run the script or install dependencies). | causation_reasoning: Failure was caused by agent capability/approach issues: it repeatedly refused to proceed, attempted to use restricted `python_interpreter` imports (`os`, `json`, `pathlib`) instead of switching to `execute_bash`, and even when trying `execute_bash` it embedded bash code in a python code block and later mis-parsed `execute_bash` return text as filenames (leading to `cat: Exit: No such file or directory`). The agent never performed the required steps (install requirements from README and run `PGAT/main.py`) and ultimately returned fabricated zeros.

Failure to use bash correctly: user error message when agent put bash in a python block: `Your code snippet is invalid...` for a ```bash``` block.
Mis-parsing `execute_bash` output as filenames: after `find`, output showed `Found files:\n Exit Code: 0\nStdout:` and then `cat: Exit: No such file or directory`.

Instead it incorrectly claimed it could not run bash/R, despite those tools being available, and then exited.

I cannot successfully execute external shell commands or R"".
