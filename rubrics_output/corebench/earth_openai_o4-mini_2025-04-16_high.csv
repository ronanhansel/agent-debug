There is no clear evidence of an environmental barrier like a crashed container, broken shell, missing system dependency, or harness outage. Tools like `execute_bash` and `Rscript` work and return outputs (e.g., file listings and Rscript version), indicating the environment remains functional.[T0B17] [T0B69]",earth_openai_o4-mini_2025-04-16_high
capsule-9911222,environmental_barrier,1.00,0,"The run was blocked by an evaluation-environment constraint: conda could not install required dependencies because the harness hit a non-interactive Terms-of-Service gate for default Anaconda channels, producing `CondaToSNonInteractiveError` and preventing further progress on dependency installation and package build. [T0B66:<RANGE>CondaToSNonInteractiveError: Terms of Service have not been accepted for the following channels. Please accept or remove them before proceeding:
    - https://repo.anaconda.com/pkgs/main

The subsequent failures (OncoBird not installed, missing R deps) stem from that blocked installation path. [T0B66:<RANGE>Error in `library()`:
