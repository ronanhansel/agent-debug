Key failure points:
1) Notebook execution halts immediately due to missing dependency:
- In the executed notebook JSON the first code cell output is: ""ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'matplotlib'"". This prevents downstream cells from running, so no ConvLSTM/LSTM metrics or Essen std-dev figure are produced.
This is not an environmental barrier by rubric: matplotlib is a pure pip-installable dependency in typical Python environments; the agent could likely install it (and any other missing deps) and re-run.

2) nbconvert output-path misuse causing nbconvert crashes / incomplete tracebacks:
- Multiple logs show nbconvert writing to a duplicated path like ""environment/code/environment/code/visualize_results_executed.ipynb"" or "".html"" and then crashing with a traceback cut off at ""nbconvertapp.py"", e.g.:
  ""[NbConvertApp] Writing 12668 bytes to environment/code/environment/code/visualize_results_executed.ipynb\nTraceback ... nbconvertapp.py"", and similarly during HTML conversion.
This indicates command-usage/path issues (and possibly a tooling/version quirk), but not a fundamental permission/read-only/network barrier. A capable agent could avoid this by (a) running nbconvert from within environment/code, (b) using --output-dir consistently, (c) omitting path prefixes in --output, or (d) using jupyter-nbconvert with correct relative paths.

Because the core blocker is missing Python packages plus incorrect nbconvert invocation, the task is not ""MECHANICALLY IMPOSSIBLE regardless of agent skill."" It is plausibly solvable with correct dependency installation and command usage, so this is scored as an agent capability issue.","All models failed, but the failure signatures are consistent with (i) missing matplotlib and (ii) path/command handling mistakes (ConvLSTM/LSTM undefined because notebook never ran). Cross-model agreement that matplotlib/definitions were missing does not prove an environmental barrier; it more strongly suggests everyone got stuck early and did not complete dependency installation or adjust execution strategy. The rubric requires score=1 only when no agent could overcome it; here, the errors are typical resolvable setup issues."
