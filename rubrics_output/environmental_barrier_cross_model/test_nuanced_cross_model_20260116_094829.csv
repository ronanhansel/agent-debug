- `/bin/sh: 1: Rscript: not found` (Exit Code 127) when attempting to install R packages via `Rscript -e ...` and when attempting to run the pipeline.
Because the task explicitly requires running `Main.R` via `Rscript` (and generating Fig 1/2 PNG outputs), the absence of `Rscript` makes the core execution mechanically impossible. The agent attempted to find pre-generated outputs as a workaround: 
- `ls: cannot access '/results': No such file or directory` and `find . -iname 'Fig*.png'` returned nothing, meaning the needed figures are not already present to extract HR / Fisher's P.
With neither (a) R available to generate figures nor (b) precomputed figure artifacts available, there is no path to obtain the required values within this environment.","All 5 models failed, and the shared error pattern includes inability to proceed (""Rscript not found"" / ""not found""). At least one model (o3) reportedly tried `apt_install`, and another (o4-mini) tried `conda_install`, yet failures persisted across models, consistent with an environment where R cannot be installed/used (or is absent and un-installable within constraints). This convergence across diverse attempted installation approaches increases confidence that the blocker is infrastructural rather than a single-agent mistake."
capsule-9832712,gpt-4.1-04-14,environmental_barrier,1.00,False,,gpt-4.1-04-14;gpt-5;o3-04-16;o4-mini-04-16;o4-mini-04-16,"The blocking failure is the absence of an R runtime (Rscript) in the execution environment, making the required step “Run 'master_script.R' using Rscript” mechanically impossible.

Evidence: multiple attempts to run Rscript fail with a shell-level command-not-found error:
- “R package installation output: Exit Code: 127 … /bin/sh: 1: Rscript: not found”
- “master_script.R execution output: Exit Code: 127 … /bin/sh: 1: Rscript: not found”

Because the benchmark explicitly requires executing master_script.R (which sources R files and renders RMarkdown; see printed master_script.R lines using source() and rmarkdown::render()), and because Rscript is missing, no agent can complete the mandated execution or generate the cleaned results outputs needed to answer the two figure/table questions.

A secondary issue appears: the sandboxed python_interpreter forbids Python’s open() (“Forbidden function evaluation: 'open' …”), but the agent successfully worked around this via bash echo redirection. Therefore, that restriction is not the root cause.

The agent’s fallback to grepping/inspecting existing files does not change the barrier determination: the task requires running the pipeline, and the needed values are produced dynamically during RMarkdown rendering; without R, they cannot be computed in this environment.","All 5 models failed (per cross-model summary) and the shared pattern includes attempts involving R execution and even apt_install (gpt-5, o4-mini) without success. The transcript shows the failure is not an R package install problem but an absent executable (Rscript). Given multiple models tried installation avenues, the convergence suggests an infrastructure-level missing runtime rather than a single-model reasoning lapse."
