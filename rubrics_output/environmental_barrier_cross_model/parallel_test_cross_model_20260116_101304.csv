Evidence: when attempting to run the required scripts, the shell returns ""/bin/sh: 1: Rscript: not found"" with exit code 0 shown in the harness log block. This prevents running `main-ctrpv.R`, `main-nci.R`, and `main-network-generation.R`, which the task explicitly requires to compute the requested PR-curve AUC. The agent also searched for precomputed outputs and found none: grep reports ""./results: No such file or directory"" (and similarly for ./environment/results and ./environment/code/results), indicating expected results directories/outputs are not present to read the AUC from. The README does not contain the numeric AUC either (agent’s inspection indicates no reported PR AUC values). Given (a) Rscript is absent and (b) no results artifacts exist to extract the AUC without running R, the task is mechanically impossible in this environment regardless of agent skill.","All 5 models failed, with consistent error patterns centered on missing executables and/or files (e.g., ""Rscript: not found"", ""no such file""). Multiple tool attempts were tried across models (apt_install, downloads, symlink creation, python/r execution). The convergence on the same missing-runtime failure strongly suggests an environment-level limitation rather than reasoning errors. No model produced evidence that R could be installed or that outputs existed elsewhere."

Evidence from transcript:
- The test path expects a saved model state and immediately tries to load it: `model.load_state_dict(torch.load(variable_file, ...))` and crashes with:
  `FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: './data/cache/variable/bert/resume'`.
  This indicates the benchmark environment does not contain the expected checkpoint file needed to run `--state test`.
- Separately, the code also hard-codes a BERT location `/data/bert-base-chinese/` which is not available in this environment, producing:
  `HFValidationError: Repo id must be in the form ...: '/data/bert-base-chinese/'` and stack trace showing `BertModel.from_pretrained('/data/bert-base-chinese/')`.
  This is another missing external resource expected by the repository setup.

These are not merely agent mistakes: the evaluation requires running in test mode to report p/r/f1, but execution cannot proceed without the missing checkpoint (and originally, without the missing BERT directory). Without these artifacts, no agent can mechanically obtain the requested test metrics from this run in this environment.","All 5 models failed, with consistent signals of missing required files/paths. The cross-model summary reports missing `./data/cache/variable/bert/resume` and also mentions attempts to create directories/symlinks and patch paths, implying multiple agents tried common workarounds. The repeated inability to locate required checkpoint/model resources across models suggests the benchmark container is missing artifacts that the code assumes exist (or assumes network access/host-mounted `/data`), which is an environmental/setup barrier rather than a single agent's reasoning failure."

Evidence: nbconvert successfully wrote the file multiple times: ""[NbConvertApp] Writing 339189 bytes to environment/code/results/FS-Filters_out.html"" with Exit Code: 0 in later attempts. The earlier failure (Exit Code: 1) was due to a missing output directory / mis-specified output path, not an environment-level block: it attempted to write under ""environment/code/results/"" and crashed during writer step (stack trace ends at nbconvert writer). Creating the directory fixed it (""mkdir -p environment/code/results"" then nbconvert Exit Code: 0). The remaining ""failure"" is agent-side: the agent got stuck in loops (re-running installs/nbconvert, not completing final submission) and relied on a tool summary instead of directly extracting from the HTML. This is a capability/procedure issue, not a barrier that prevents any agent from succeeding.","Although the cross-model summary says all 5 models failed, the cited errors (e.g., ""No module named 'sklearn'"", ""not found"", occasional ""permission denied"") are not definitive environmental barriers because: (1) the environment clearly allowed pip installs (jupyter/nbconvert installed successfully), (2) the notebook-to-HTML conversion succeeded and produced an output file, and (3) missing Python packages like sklearn are typically installable via pip/conda unless network/ToS restrictions are shown (none are evidenced here). The consistent multi-model failure is better explained by agent workflows failing to robustly parse the HTML / manage paths rather than an impassable infra defect."

Evidence of failure point:
- The run of `empath_train.py` fails with a Pandas API misuse:
  - `TypeError: DataFrame.drop() takes from 1 to 2 positional arguments but 3 were given` at
  - `X = np.array(recipes.drop(['label'], 1))` (line 57).
- Earlier, the script also failed because metrics used mismatched label vectors:
  - `print (precision_score(y, pred, average=""weighted""))` causing sklearn label-check failure (trace shows precision_score called with `y` rather than `y_test`).

Why this is not an environmental barrier:
- This is not a permission/network/sandbox/dependency crash issue. It is deterministic Python-level breakage due to outdated Pandas calling convention and incorrect variable usage.
- The transcript itself demonstrates a viable fix path: the agent patches `drop(['label'], 1)` to `drop(['label'], axis=1)` and patches metric calls from `y` to `y_test`. After these edits, the script successfully runs and prints all four KNN metrics with exit code 0.

So the task is mechanically possible in the environment; the agent’s failure is due to inconsistent/unsuccessful patch application and repeated reruns, not an infrastructure blockade.","Although the cross-model summary says all 5 models failed, the observed error patterns (e.g., NameError/undefined variables, Pandas drop signature errors, wrong target vector used for metrics) are classic agent patching/reasoning issues rather than systemic environment failures (no ToS block, no missing headers, no permission denials, no network blocks). The transcript includes evidence that execution can succeed after correct edits, so “all models failed” more likely reflects shared patching mistakes than an impassable barrier."

Evidence from transcript:
- Notebook execution produced an executed .ipynb, but first cell errored: ""ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'matplotlib'"" (shown in the provided full file snippet: outputs[0] ename=ModuleNotFoundError, evalue=No module named 'matplotlib'). This prevented downstream cells from running, so no ConvLSTM/LSTM errors or Essen std-dev figure were generated.
- Separately, nbconvert commands repeatedly wrote to a wrong path like ""environment/code/environment/code/visualize_results_executed.ipynb"" and HTML conversion failed with a traceback after writing to ""environment/code/environment/code/visualize_results_executed.html"". This indicates a path/CLI usage issue; nbconvert itself is functioning (it writes files) but the command parameters were misapplied (using --output with a path instead of --output-dir + basename, etc.).

Why this is not an environmental barrier:
- A missing Python library (matplotlib) is not inherently ""mechanically impossible"" in this setting; it is typically resolvable via pip/conda. The transcript does not show an impassable install blocker (no CondaToSNonInteractiveError, no network-denied errors, no permission-denied on site-packages, no read-only FS).
- The nbconvert path duplication is a solvable invocation problem; an agent could call nbconvert from the target directory, use --output-dir properly, or omit path in --output. It’s not a kernel panic / crash / sandbox prohibition.

Therefore the failure is attributable to agent capability/tooling choices (not completing correct dependency installation from README; not correcting nbconvert invocation; not using an alternate execution route), not an environment barrier.","All 5 models failed, but their errors cluster around fixable issues: missing matplotlib and NameError/undefined symbols (cfg, ConvLSTM/LSTM), plus parsing/""not found"" outcomes. These are consistent with notebooks not executing due to unmet dependencies and/or insufficient setup, not with an infrastructure-level prohibition. No model reports hallmark impassable signals (ToS lockout, blocked imports by sandbox policy, permission denial, network denial, missing system headers with no sudo, etc.). Cross-model consensus of failure here more likely reflects a common oversight (not installing requirements correctly) than a mechanical impossibility."
