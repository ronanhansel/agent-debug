capsule-5507257,environmental_barrier,0.00,0,"The failure in the transcript is not due to an environmental barrier but rather an agent capability issue. The agent repeatedly encounters a 'ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'keras'' error when attempting to run the script. However, the agent has the ability to resolve this issue by ensuring the correct installation of the required dependencies (e.g., TensorFlow and Keras) and verifying compatibility between them. Additionally, the agent identifies that the script expects files in '/data/' but the actual files are located in './environment/data/'. The agent correctly creates symlinks to address this issue. These actions demonstrate that the task is not mechanically impossible, and the agent could have succeeded with better reasoning and execution. Therefore, this is not an environmental barrier.",corebench_hard_hal_generalist_agentgpt41_1755644685_UPLOAD
capsule-9137200,environmental_barrier,0.00,0,"The transcript shows that the agent encountered several issues related to missing Python packages such as 'torch', 'matplotlib', and 'transformers'. However, these are not environmental barriers as defined by the rubric. The agent could have potentially overcome these issues by ensuring the correct versions of the packages were installed or by using alternative methods to install them. The errors encountered are related to package management and version compatibility, which fall under agent capability issues. The agent repeatedly attempted to install the necessary packages, indicating that the infrastructure itself was not blocking the task. Therefore, this is not a mechanically impossible task due to infrastructure defects, but rather an issue of agent capability in managing dependencies.",corebench_hard_hal_generalist_agentgpt41_1755644685_UPLOAD
capsule-6003668,environmental_barrier,0.00,0,"The failure is not due to an environmental barrier but rather an agent capability issue. The agent repeatedly encounters the error 'No section: Training Setting' because it fails to correctly configure the default.ini file or ensure the script accesses the correct configuration file. The transcript shows multiple attempts to copy and modify the configuration file, but the agent does not verify the content of default.ini or ensure it matches the expected format. Additionally, the agent does not explore alternative debugging methods, such as explicitly printing the contents of the configuration file or checking the working directory of the Python process. These actions could have resolved the issue, indicating that the failure is due to insufficient reasoning and debugging rather than an impassable infrastructure defect.",corebench_hard_hal_generalist_agentgpt41_1755644685_UPLOAD
capsule-9911222,environmental_barrier,0.00,0,"The agent repeatedly failed to execute the task due to a lack of proper setup and dependency installation, which are outlined in the README file. The transcript shows that the agent did not fully utilize the information provided in the README to install the necessary R version and dependencies (e.g., 'devtools' and other potential packages). Additionally, the agent did not attempt alternative methods to install R or dependencies, such as using conda or a user-level installation. These failures are due to agent capability issues, as a more skilled agent could have resolved the setup and proceeded with the task. There is no evidence of an environmental barrier that would make the task mechanically impossible for any agent.",corebench_hard_hal_generalist_agentgpt41_1755644685_UPLOAD
capsule-8536428,environmental_barrier,0.00,0,"The transcript shows that the agent encountered issues related to modifying and running Python scripts, specifically replacing file paths and implementing train/test splits. However, these issues stem from the agent's approach and tool usage rather than an impassable environmental barrier. The agent could have succeeded by correctly using the provided tools (e.g., edit_file) to modify the scripts and adapt them to the available data. There is no evidence of infrastructure defects, such as missing files, sandbox restrictions, or system-level errors, that would make the task mechanically impossible for any agent.",corebench_hard_hal_generalist_agentgpt41_1755644685_UPLOAD
capsule-7716865,environmental_barrier,0.00,0,"The transcript shows multiple attempts to install necessary software and dependencies for rendering an RMarkdown file to PDF. The agent encounters errors related to missing installations (e.g., R, LaTeX, Pandoc) and permission issues for R package installations. However, these are not environmental barriers as the agent successfully installs R, LaTeX, and Pandoc eventually. The agent also resolves the R package installation issue by using a user-local library. The final error regarding Pandoc version suggests the installed version is insufficient, but the agent could potentially resolve this by installing a newer version or using a different method. Therefore, the failures are due to agent capability issues, not impassable infrastructure defects.",corebench_hard_hal_generalist_agentgpt41_1755644685_UPLOAD
capsule-0851068,environmental_barrier,1.00,0,"The transcript indicates that the required data files (/data/covid/val and /data/final_model.pth) are missing, and there are no instructions or mechanisms provided in the repository (e.g., README or setup scripts) to obtain them. This makes it mechanically impossible for any agent to reproduce the results or complete the task. The absence of these files constitutes a true environmental barrier as no alternative actions or tools could overcome this limitation.",corebench_hard_hal_generalist_agentgpt41_1755644685_UPLOAD
capsule-9660931,environmental_barrier,0.00,0,"The transcript does not indicate the presence of an environmental barrier that makes the task mechanically impossible. The agent repeatedly encounters the error 'ls: cannot access '../results': No such file or directory', which suggests a pathing issue rather than an impassable infrastructure defect. The agent could have resolved this by correctly identifying the path to the results directory or ensuring the directory's existence. Additionally, the agent successfully installs dependencies and executes the notebook, indicating that the infrastructure is functional. Therefore, the issues encountered are due to agent capability limitations, such as incorrect path usage, rather than an environmental barrier.",corebench_hard_hal_generalist_agentgpt41_1755644685_UPLOAD
capsule-3449234,environmental_barrier,0.00,0,"The agent repeatedly failed to execute the Jupyter notebook due to missing dependencies or setup issues, but these failures are not due to an environmental barrier. The agent had access to the requirements.txt file and could have installed the necessary dependencies. Additionally, the agent did not attempt alternative methods to resolve the issues, such as verifying the Python environment or ensuring the correct kernel was used.

capsule-2345790,environmental_barrier,0.00,0,"The transcript shows multiple attempts by the agent to identify and install necessary R packages by searching for 'library()' and 'require()' calls in .Rmd files. The agent encounters errors due to incorrect regex usage and unsupported file format for conversion, but these are not impassable barriers. The agent could have used alternative methods to parse the .Rmd files, such as using a different tool or manually inspecting the files. The errors encountered are due to agent capability issues, such as incorrect tool usage and not due to infrastructure limitations that make the task mechanically impossible.",corebench_hard_hal_generalist_agentgpt41_1755644685_UPLOAD
