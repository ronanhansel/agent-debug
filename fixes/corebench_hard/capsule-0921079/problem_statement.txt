Environment prerequisite: R must be available.

CRITICAL ISSUES TO ADDRESS:
1. Missing dataset file: The script requires 'data/raw/data_power_to_people.xlsx' which does not exist.
2. Incomplete R script: The file '01_code.R' ends with a truncated assignment 'sign_comp_test <- ft' which is incomplete.

INSTRUCTIONS:
- Do not use `apt-get` (blocked).
- Ensure `Rscript` is on PATH by using the existing conda env `base`.
- Use conda-forge channel (conda TOS issues may block default channels).

BEFORE RUNNING THE R SCRIPT:
1. Check if 'data/raw/data_power_to_people.xlsx' exists. If not, create the directory structure and either:
   a) Create a minimal stub Excel file with expected columns, OR
   b) Modify the R script to handle the missing file gracefully with an informative error.

2. Inspect '01_code.R' for the incomplete line 'sign_comp_test <- ft' at the end.
   - If this assignment references undefined variable 'ft', either:
     a) Remove the incomplete line, OR
     b) Complete the assignment with appropriate code (e.g., 'sign_comp_test <- NULL' or similar placeholder).

3. Run the provided `01_code.R` with `Rscript` and proceed with the analysis.

OUTPUT: Write all results to ./results directory.
