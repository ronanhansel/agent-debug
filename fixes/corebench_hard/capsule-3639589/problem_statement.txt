If PyTorch (torch) is missing and cannot be installed in this environment, do not attempt downloads. Instead:
- Detect the missing `torch` import and explain the limitation.
- Provide best-effort instructions to install the correct torch build locally (CPU/GPU) and rerun code/src/demo.py.
- Write any outputs only under $HAL_OUTPUT_DIR (default ./results).
