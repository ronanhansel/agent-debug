Environment constraints:

CRITICAL ISSUES:
1. The repository's requirements.txt pins numpy==1.16.5 and torch==1.2.0, which are INCOMPATIBLE with Python 3.11.
2. numpy==1.16.5 fails to build metadata under Python 3.11.
3. torch==1.2.0 is not available from current wheel indexes.
4. Sandbox restrictions block pickle and subprocess imports, limiting debugging.

INSTRUCTIONS:
- Do NOT use `apt-get` (blocked).
- Do NOT install numpy==1.16.5 or torch==1.2.0 - they will fail.
- Use modern versions compatible with Python 3.11.

DEPENDENCY OVERRIDE:
The pinned versions in requirements.txt must be overridden. Use:
- numpy>=1.23 (supports Python 3.11)
- torch>=2.0 (CPU-only is sufficient)

INSTALLATION:
1. Do NOT run `pip install -r requirements.txt` directly - it will fail.
2. Instead, manually install compatible versions:
   ```
   pip install numpy>=1.23 torch>=2.0 --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
   ```
3. Then install any other dependencies that are compatible.

WORKAROUND FOR RESTRICTED IMPORTS:
- Do NOT use `import pickle` or `import subprocess` in debugging code - they are blocked.
- If the main script uses these, it should be fine at runtime, but inserted debug code cannot.

EXECUTION:
After installing compatible dependencies, run the main script (e.g., `demo.py` or `main.py`).
Write outputs to `./results` directory.
