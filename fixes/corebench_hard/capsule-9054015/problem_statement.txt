IMPORTANT ENVIRONMENT INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Conda installations are BLOCKED by Terms of Service:
   - CondaToSNonInteractiveError for https://repo.anaconda.com/pkgs/main
   - CondaToSNonInteractiveError for https://repo.anaconda.com/pkgs/r
   DO NOT attempt conda install commands - they will fail.

2. System headers are MISSING - R package compilation will fail:
   - Error: 'fatal error: ft2build.h: No such file or directory'
   - FreeType headers required for systemfonts package
   - This blocks tidyverse installation from CRAN

3. tidyverse is NOT AVAILABLE:
   - library(tidyverse) will fail with "no package called 'tidyverse'"
   - Cannot be installed due to missing system headers
   - Cannot be installed via conda due to ToS restrictions

4. Alternative approaches:

   a) Check what R packages ARE installed:
      Rscript -e "installed.packages()[,'Package']"

   b) Use base R alternatives for tidyverse functions:
      - read.csv() instead of readr::read_csv()
      - subset(), merge() instead of dplyr functions
      - aggregate() for group operations
      - base R plotting instead of ggplot2

   c) If the script requires tidyverse:
      - Modify the script to use base R
      - Or report as environmental limitation

   d) Example base R replacements:
      # Instead of: library(tidyverse)
      # Use individual packages if available, or base R:

      # Reading data:
      data <- read.csv("file.csv")

      # Filtering:
      subset(data, column > value)

      # Selecting columns:
      data[, c("col1", "col2")]

      # Summarizing:
      aggregate(value ~ group, data, mean)

5. Environment:
   conda activate hal
   # Do NOT run conda install or install.packages() for tidyverse

6. Output directory: HAL_OUTPUT_DIR (../results).

Original task: Run R analysis script that uses tidyverse.
