This task failed because `Rscript` is not available and `apt-get` installs are blocked.

Guidance:
- Install/provide `Rscript` via conda in env `hal` (`r-base` from `conda-forge`).
- Set a writable R library path (`R_LIBS_USER=./.R/library`) for any package installs.
- Run `pancancer_calculation.R` using the conda-provided `Rscript` only after `Rscript --version` succeeds.
