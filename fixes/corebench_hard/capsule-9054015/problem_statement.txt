This task failed because:
- Conda installation of r-base was blocked by non-interactive Terms-of-Service error.
- The tidyverse installation failed due to missing system headers (ft2build.h) for systemfonts.

Guidance:
- Use conda-forge channel exclusively (set via env_override) to bypass ToS gates.
- Install `r-base`, `r-tidyverse`, `r-systemfonts`, `freetype`, and `fontconfig` via conda-forge (precompiled, no system headers needed).
- Set a writable R library path (`R_LIBS_USER=./.R/library`) for any additional package installs.
- Verify `Rscript --version` succeeds before running `pancancer_calculation.R`.
- Do not use `apt-get` for any installations.
