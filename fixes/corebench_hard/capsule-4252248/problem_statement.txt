This task requires running several R scripts (e.g., `main-ctrpv.R`, `main-nci.R`, `main-network-generation.R`) to compute PR curve AUC.

Environment constraints:
- `R`/`Rscript` are not available by default.
- Do not use `apt-get` (blocked).
- Avoid unsupported conda flags like `--force`.

Guidance:
- Use the existing conda env `base` to install/provide `r-base` from `conda-forge`.
- Use a writable R package library (set `R_LIBS_USER=./.R/library`) if packages must be installed.
- Write outputs into a writable directory like `./results` (not `../results`).

After setup, verify `Rscript --version` works and then run the R scripts as instructed.
