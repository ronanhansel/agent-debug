ENVIRONMENT SETUP (Pre-configured):
- R packages are pre-installed via conda (tidyverse, dplyr, ggplot2, rmarkdown, knitr, lme4, etc.)
- Bioconductor packages (GSVA) are available
- Use: conda activate agent
- R library path: ./.R/library

---
1. Conda installations are BLOCKED by Terms of Service requirements:
   DO NOT attempt conda install commands - they will fail.

2. Missing R/Bioconductor packages:
   - PharmacoGx (Bioconductor package)
   - netbiov
   - apcluster
   - rcdk

3. Missing system dependencies:
   - pkg-config
   - libxml2
   - libcurl
   - openssl

4. File inspection limitations:
   - .R files may not be readable by the inspection tool
   - Use bash 'cat' to read R script contents: cat code/script.R

5. Alternative approaches:

   a) Check what packages are already installed:
      Rscript -e "installed.packages()[,'Package']"

   b) If PharmacoGx is not installed:
      - The AUC computation requires PharmacoGx
      - Report that the analysis cannot be completed due to missing

   c) Look for pre-computed results:
      - Check if ../results or data/ directories contain cached outputs
      - ls -la ../results/ data/

   d) If the package is available, run:
      Rscript code/your_analysis.R

6. Environment:
   conda activate hal
   # Do NOT run conda install - it will fail

7. Output directory setup:
   mkdir -p ../results
   # Ensure all outputs go to HAL_OUTPUT_DIR (../results)

8. To extract AUC values, you need PharmacoGx. If unavailable:
   - Report this as an environmental limitation

Original task: Run R scripts to compute AUC values using PharmacoGx.
