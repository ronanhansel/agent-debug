ENVIRONMENT SETUP (Pre-configured):
- R packages are pre-installed via conda (tidyverse, dplyr, ggplot2, rmarkdown, knitr, lme4, etc.)
- Bioconductor packages (GSVA) are available
- Use: conda activate agent
- R library path: ./.R/library

---
1. Conda installations are BLOCKED by Terms of Service:
   DO NOT attempt conda install commands - they will fail.

2. CMake is MISSING from PATH:
   - Configuration log shows: 'checking for cmake... no'
   - CMake is required for building some R packages
   - Report as environmental limitation if CMake is required

3. Vision-language tool has INVALID model name:
   - Error: 'Invalid model name passed in model=gpt-4o-2024-11-20'
   - This model identifier is not supported
   - DO NOT use vision-language tool with this model name
   - If vision analysis is required, report model unavailability

4. File writing and setwd restrictions:
   - Sandbox restrictions may prevent file writing
   - setwd() may fail due to path restrictions
   - Use relative paths and ensure directories exist

5. Alternative approaches:

   a) For R script execution:
      - Use the 'hal' conda environment: conda activate hal
      - Check what packages are pre-installed
      - Avoid packages requiring CMake compilation

   b) For Main.R execution:
      - Check if xvfb-run is needed/available: which xvfb-run
      - If xvfb-run unavailable, run: Rscript code/Main.R
      - Without xvfb-run: set options(bitmapType = 'cairo') if graphics needed

   c) For directory operations:
      mkdir -p ../results
      # Use HAL_OUTPUT_DIR for outputs

6. Environment:
   conda activate hal
   # Do NOT run conda install

7. Output directory: HAL_OUTPUT_DIR (../results).

Original task: Run Main.R to produce required outputs.
