This task failed due to missing `Rscript`, missing `xvfb-run`, and a missing results directory.

Environment constraints:
- Do not use `apt-get`.
- Provide dependencies via conda (env `base`) where possible.

Guidance:
- Install `r-base` and an X virtual framebuffer implementation (e.g., `xorg-xvfb`) via `conda-forge`.
- Use `xvfb-run` only if the pipeline requires a virtual display; otherwise run `Rscript` directly.
- Ensure outputs are written to a writable directory like `./results` and create it before running.
- Set `R_LIBS_USER=./.R/library` for any R package installs.

After setup, run `Main.R` and ensure the expected results artifacts are produced under `./results`.
