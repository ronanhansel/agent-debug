Environment constraints:

CRITICAL ISSUES:
1. Jupyter/nbconvert tooling is not installed
2. Parent directory is NOT writable - cannot create '../results'
3. Restricted imports (e.g., 'json') prevent some programmatic operations
4. Base64 encoded outputs in notebook cannot be easily processed

INSTRUCTIONS:
- Do NOT use `apt-get` (blocked).
- Do NOT write to '../results' - the parent directory is read-only.
- Use `./results` as the output directory instead.
- Use conda (env `base`) with conda-forge channel.

OUTPUT DIRECTORY FIX:
The task may reference '../results' which will FAIL. Always use:
- `./results` (relative to workspace root)
- Or `$HAL_OUTPUT_DIR` if set in environment

Before running:
```
mkdir -p ./results
```

NOTEBOOK EXECUTION:
Install tooling first:
```
pip install jupyter nbconvert ipykernel
```

Then execute notebook with explicit kernel and allow-errors:
```
jupyter nbconvert --to html --execute \
    --ExecutePreprocessor.kernel_name=python3 \
    --ExecutePreprocessor.timeout=-1 \
    --allow-errors \
    --output-dir=./results \
    your_notebook.ipynb
```

RESTRICTED IMPORTS:
- Do NOT use `import json` in agent code if blocked by sandbox.
- If you need to parse JSON-like data, try yaml or ast.literal_eval as alternatives.

BASE64 OUTPUTS:
Notebook outputs may be base64 encoded. If you cannot decode them due to import restrictions, note this limitation and focus on executing the notebook to produce HTML output.
