This task failed due to missing notebook tooling and an unwritable output path.

Environment constraints:
- `jupyter` is not installed by default.
- The parent directory is not writable, so creating `../results` fails.

Guidance:
- Install `jupyter` + `nbconvert` (and `ipykernel`) inside conda env `base`.
- Write outputs to `./results` instead of `../results`.
- Keep required nbconvert flags (e.g., allow errors, disable timeout) as specified by the task.
