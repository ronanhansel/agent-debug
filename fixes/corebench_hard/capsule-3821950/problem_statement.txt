If R/Rscript or R packages cannot be installed due to permissions (e.g., /usr/local/lib/R/site-library not writable), do not attempt system installs. Instead:
- Set/use a user-writable R library path via $R_LIBS_USER (provided) and explain how to install packages there.
- If Rscript itself is missing, explain the limitation.
- Provide local steps to render ktc_11_paper.Rmd.
- Write any outputs only under $HAL_OUTPUT_DIR (default ./results).
