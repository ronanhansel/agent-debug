Environment constraints:

CRITICAL ISSUES:
1. R package 'rmarkdown' is missing: "there is no package called 'rmarkdown'"
2. Conda TOS blocks default channels: CondaToSNonInteractiveError
3. R package installation attempts write to non-writable system library
4. Sandbox restrictions on imports (os, bs4, csv) limit processing of rendered HTML

INSTRUCTIONS:
- Do NOT use `apt-get` (blocked).
- Use conda (env `base`) with conda-forge channel EXCLUSIVELY.
- Install R packages via conda, NOT install.packages() (system library is not writable).

REQUIRED SETUP:
1. Set R_LIBS_USER to a writable directory: `./.R/library`
2. Create the directory if it doesn't exist: `mkdir -p ./.R/library`
3. Create results/figures directory: `mkdir -p ./results/figures`

CONDA PACKAGES TO INSTALL:
- r-base, r-rmarkdown, r-knitr, r-ggplot2, r-dplyr, r-tidyr, r-lubridate, r-scales
- pandoc (for rendering Rmd files)

VERIFICATION:
Before rendering, verify rmarkdown is available:
```
Rscript -e "library(rmarkdown); print('rmarkdown OK')"
```

EXECUTION:
Render the Rmd file:
```
Rscript -e "rmarkdown::render('ktc_11_paper.Rmd', output_dir='./results')"
```

OUTPUT: Write all results to `./results` directory. Create `./results/figures` if the script needs it.

NOTE: Sandbox restrictions may block `import os`, `import bs4`, `import csv`. If you need to process the rendered HTML, use allowed methods only.
