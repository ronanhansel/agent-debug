IMPORTANT ENVIRONMENT INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Python 'os' module import is BLOCKED:
   - Error: 'Import of os is not allowed'
   - DO NOT import os in Python code
   - For file path operations, use bash commands via execute_bash instead

2. .Rmd file inspection is NOT SUPPORTED:
   - Error: 'The formats ['.Rmd'] are not supported'
   - UnsupportedFormatException for .Rmd files
   - Use bash 'cat' to read .Rmd content instead: cat path/to/file.Rmd

3. Conda installations are BLOCKED:
   - CondaToSNonInteractiveError for default channels
   - PackagesNotFoundError for r-bchron (not in conda-forge)
   - DO NOT attempt conda install commands

4. Alternative approaches:

   a) For reading .Rmd files:
      - Use bash: cat code/your_file.Rmd
      - Extract R code chunks manually
      - Run R code using Rscript via execute_bash

   b) For file system operations:
      - Use execute_bash instead of Python os module
      - ls -la to list files
      - mkdir -p to create directories
      - cp/mv for file operations

   c) For rendering .Rmd to HTML:
      Rscript -e "rmarkdown::render('code/your_file.Rmd', output_dir='../results')"

5. Missing R packages (r-bchron, ggmap):
   - These are not available in conda-forge
   - If the analysis requires them and they're not pre-installed, report as
     environmental limitation
   - Try using base R alternatives or skip those specific analyses

6. Create output directories via bash:
   mkdir -p ../results/figures

7. Environment:
   conda activate hal
   # Do NOT run conda install

8. All outputs should go to HAL_OUTPUT_DIR (../results).

Original task: Render the R Markdown file and produce required outputs.
