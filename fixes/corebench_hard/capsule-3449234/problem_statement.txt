IMPORTANT ENVIRONMENT INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Conda installations are BLOCKED by Terms of Service requirements:
   - CondaToSNonInteractiveError for https://repo.anaconda.com/pkgs/main
   - CondaToSNonInteractiveError for https://repo.anaconda.com/pkgs/r
   DO NOT attempt conda install commands - they will fail.

2. Python file I/O is RESTRICTED:
   - The 'open()' function is FORBIDDEN in the sandbox
   - DO NOT use open() to read HTML or any other files
   - This will cause InterpreterError

3. Alternative approaches for reading file contents:

   a) Use the TextInspectorTool or inspect_file_as_text tool:
      - This is the approved method for reading file contents
      - Example: inspect_file_as_text('results/visualize_results.html')

   b) Use bash commands via execute_bash:
      - cat results/visualize_results.html
      - grep "pattern" results/visualize_results.html
      - head -n 100 results/visualize_results.html

4. For notebook execution:
   - Use the notebook execution tools provided by the harness
   - Do NOT rely on conda for dependency installation
   - Use pre-installed packages in the 'hal' environment

5. Environment setup:
   conda activate hal
   # Dependencies should already be available - do NOT run conda install

6. To extract results from HTML output:
   - Use bash: cat results/visualize_results.html | grep "value"
   - Or use the TextInspectorTool to read the file
   - Parse the content and extract needed values

7. Output directory: HAL_OUTPUT_DIR (../results or results/).

Original task: Execute the notebook and extract results from the HTML output.
