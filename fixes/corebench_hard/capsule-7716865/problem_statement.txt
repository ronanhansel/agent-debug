ENVIRONMENT SETUP (Pre-configured):
- R packages are pre-installed via conda (tidyverse, dplyr, ggplot2, rmarkdown, knitr, lme4, etc.)
- Bioconductor packages (GSVA) are available
- Use: conda activate agent
- R library path: ./.R/library

---
1. Conda installations are BLOCKED by Terms of Service:
   DO NOT attempt conda install commands - they will fail.

2. Missing system-level dependencies:
   - R may not be fully installed
   - pandoc is NOT available
   - pdflatex is NOT available
   - CMake is NOT available
   These CANNOT be installed due to environment restrictions.

3. R package installation will fail:
   - CMake is required for some R packages but missing

4. File I/O restrictions:
   - '../results' directory may NOT be writable
   - File reading may be forbidden for some paths (e.g., data/*.csv)
   - Use HAL_OUTPUT_DIR for outputs

5. Alternative approaches:

   a) For Rmd rendering without pandoc/pdflatex:
      - Cannot render to PDF without pdflatex
      - Try HTML output: rmarkdown::render('file.Rmd', output_format='html_document')
      - If pandoc is missing, rendering will fail entirely

   b) For data file access:
      - Check if files exist: ls -la data/
      - Use bash cat to read CSV if Python I/O blocked
      - Use R read.csv() if available

   c) For output:
      mkdir -p ../results
      # Or use a writable temp directory

6. If manuscript.Rmd cannot be rendered:
   - Report that pandoc/pdflatex are missing
   - Extract key values by running R code chunks directly
   - Read the .Rmd as text and identify computations

7. Environment:
   conda activate hal
   # Do NOT run conda install

8. Output directory: Use HAL_OUTPUT_DIR or ensure ../results exists and is writable.

Original task: Render manuscript.Rmd and extract required values.
