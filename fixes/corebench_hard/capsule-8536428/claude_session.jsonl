Let me provide a summary:\n\n## Summary\n\n### Diagnosis\n\nThe task (capsule-8536428) asks agents to test computational reproducibility of a fake news detection ML benchmark by running Python training scripts and extracting metrics.\n\n**The rubric scored this as 1.0 (Environmental Barrier)**, but my analysis shows it's a **mixed issue**:\n\n1. **Tool Confusion (Primary Issue)**: Models tried to use `import os` in the sandboxed `python_interpreter` tool instead of the available `execute_bash` tool. The `execute_bash` tool DOES work - gpt-4.1 made significant progress using it.\n\n2. **Documentation Gap**: The task prompt doesn't clarify that `python_interpreter` has restricted imports and that `execute_bash` should be used for filesystem operations.\n\n3. **Pandas API Compatibility**: The original code uses deprecated pandas syntax, which is a legitimate reproducibility challenge.\n\n### Fix Applied\n\nCreated `input_override.json` with clarifications that:\n- Explain to use `execute_bash` for filesystem operations and running Python scripts\n- Clarify the file location structure (`./environment/code/` and `./environment/data/`)\n\n### What the Fix Preserves\n\nThe fix does NOT:\n- Give hints about which scripts to run\n- Reveal answer values\n- Fix the pandas compatibility issue (part of the challenge)\n- Reduce computational requirements\n- Pre-install packages\n\nThe core challenge remains - agents must discover scripts, fix compatibility issues, run them, and extract metrics.","session_id":"30621315-8631-4f94-bfdb-fd1ccaa740cf","total_cost_usd":2.8437528,"usage":{"input_tokens":74,"cache_creation_input_tokens":75020,"cache_read_input_tokens":3907586,"output_tokens":13788,"server_tool_use":{"web_search_requests":0,"web_fetch_requests":0},"service_tier":"standard","cache_creation":{"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":75020}},"modelUsage":{"claude-opus-4-5-20251101":{"inputTokens":74,"outputTokens":13788,"cacheReadInputTokens":3907586,"cacheCreationInputTokens":75020,"webSearchRequests":0,"costUSD":2.767738,"contextWindow":200000,"maxOutputTokens":64000},"claude-haiku-4-5-20251001":{"inputTokens":35163,"outputTokens":2543,"cacheReadInputTokens":43543,"cacheCreationInputTokens":19026,"webSearchRequests":0,"costUSD":0.07601479999999998,"contextWindow":200000,"maxOutputTokens":64000}},"permission_denials":[],"uuid":"1d750a7f-579c-4629-b1fc-2fbe8e4cc332"}
