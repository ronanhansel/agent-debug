This task failed because `xlrd` no longer supports reading `.xlsx` files and downgrading `xlrd` causes further compatibility issues.

Guidance:
- Do not use `xlrd` for `.xlsx`.
- Install `openpyxl`.
- Update the Excel-loading code to use `pandas.read_excel(..., engine='openpyxl')` when the input file extension is `.xlsx`.
- Avoid downgrading core libraries to old versions.

After the change, the script should run to completion and generate `results/output_TCNS_ANP_TOPSIS.txt`.
