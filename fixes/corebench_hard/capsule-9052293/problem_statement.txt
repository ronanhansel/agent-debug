If reading .xlsx fails due to xlrd not supporting xlsx, do not attempt incompatible downgrades. Instead:
- Explain that modern xlrd dropped xlsx support and recommend using openpyxl (or pandas with engine=openpyxl).
- If dependency installation is blocked, provide local steps to update requirements and rerun.
- Write any outputs only under $HAL_OUTPUT_DIR (default ./results).
