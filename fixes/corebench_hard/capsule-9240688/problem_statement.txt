This task failed because:
- The repository entrypoint `run.sh` is missing.
- The sandbox forbids direct file I/O and raises UnsupportedFormatException for README files and .R scripts.
- The sandbox does not support CSV preview or certain file format conversions.

Guidance:
- Do NOT use the file-inspection tool to read .md or .R files directly. Read them as plain text using allowed methods.
- Do NOT use disallowed Python file I/O (e.g., `open()`) or modules like `csv`.
- Use allowed harness tools (e.g., inspect_file_as_text, Bash `cat`) to read file contents.
- If an entrypoint `run.sh` is required, create it via the fix package overlay at `agent/run.sh`.
- Use conda-forge to install R (`r-base`) if R scripts must be executed.
- Set `R_LIBS_USER` to a writable directory for R package installations.

Workaround for file access: Use plain text reading for all file types that cause UnsupportedFormatException.
