The instructions mention `run.sh`, but the capsule doesn’t contain that script. Instead, run the actual entry point described in the README (e.g., the R markdown files) and document the alternate workflow.

1. Inspect the repo (especially `README.md` and directories) to find the real execution path (e.g., a Python script or Rmd files). Note that `run.sh` is missing.
2. Mention this discrepancy in the final answer and follow the documented workflow anyway (for example, run `Rscript 01_motivation.R`, etc., if that matches the repo). Include any steps needed to install dependencies (R via conda, pip requirements, etc.) as in previous capsules.
3. Return the rubric answers derived from the actual scripts, and clearly state that the original `run.sh` instruction was replaced with the available scripts because the shell script is absent from the repository.
