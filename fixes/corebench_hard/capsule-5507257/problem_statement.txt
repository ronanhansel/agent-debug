This task fails due to two environment constraints:
1) The code hardcodes `/data` (not writable/does not exist here).
2) TensorFlow/Keras is not available for Python 3.13.

Guidance:
- Do not create or write to `/data`; use a writable relative directory like `./data`.
- Modify the code to read the data/model path from an environment variable (e.g., `DATA_DIR`) with a default of `./data`.
- Do not require TensorFlow. If the analysis only needs model outputs, provide a fallback path:
  - Skip model loading when TensorFlow is unavailable and instead load precomputed predictions if present, or
  - Replace the TensorFlow load with a lightweight alternative only if the repository already supports it.

Ensure all file paths are relative to the workspace and that the run completes without importing TensorFlow.
