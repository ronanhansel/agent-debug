Environment constraints:

CRITICAL ISSUES:
1. Code hardcodes '/data' path which is NOT writable or does not exist in this environment.
2. TensorFlow/Keras is NOT available for Python 3.13 - do NOT attempt to install or import them.
3. h5py module may be missing (required for loading model files).
4. Sandbox restrictions may block certain numpy imports.

INSTRUCTIONS:
- Do NOT use `apt-get` (blocked).
- Do NOT install TensorFlow or Keras - they will fail on Python 3.13.
- Use conda (env `base`) with conda-forge channel.

PATH FIX (CRITICAL):
The code uses hardcoded '/data' which will FAIL. You must:
1. Use relative paths: `./data` instead of `/data`
2. Or read from DATA_DIR environment variable: `os.environ.get('DATA_DIR', './data')`
3. Create the data directory: `mkdir -p ./data`

TENSORFLOW WORKAROUND:
Since TensorFlow is unavailable:
1. Check if precomputed predictions/outputs exist in the data directory.
2. If the task requires model inference, check for saved model outputs (.h5, .pkl, .npy files).
3. If only model loading fails, modify the code to:
   - Skip model loading when TensorFlow ImportError occurs
   - Use precomputed results if available
   - Report that TensorFlow inference was skipped

H5PY INSTALLATION:
If h5py is needed for reading model files (without TensorFlow):
```
pip install h5py
```

SETUP:
1. Create data directory: `mkdir -p ./data`
2. Create results directory: `mkdir -p ./results`
3. Ensure all file paths in code use relative paths or DATA_DIR

OUTPUT: Write all results to `./results` directory.
