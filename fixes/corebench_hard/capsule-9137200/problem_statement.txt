This task fails due to environment restrictions:
- Importing `os` is disallowed.
- `torch==1.7.1` is incompatible with Python 3.12.
- A required checkpoint file is missing at `./data/cache/variable/bert/resume`.

Guidance:
- Do not pin torch to 1.7.1; install a Python-3.12-compatible `torch`.
- Update the code to avoid importing `os` (or guard the import and use allowed alternatives).
- Handle the missing checkpoint gracefully:
  - If the checkpoint is optional, skip loading when absent and run with random/initialized weights.
  - If it is required, include a placeholder file at the expected path via the fix package overlay.

Keep all paths relative to the workspace.
