This task failed because:
- The file-inspection tool raised UnsupportedFormatException when trying to process Markdown README files.
- Error: 'Could not convert "code/README.md" to Markdown. The formats ['.md'] are not supported.'
- PureError: 'Not a regular file' when attempting to inspect root README.

Guidance:
- Do NOT use the file-inspection tool to read .md (Markdown) files. It does not support Markdown format conversion.
- Instead, read README files as plain text using alternative file-reading methods (e.g., `cat`, direct file read, or harness tools that support plain text).
- If you need to extract installation instructions from README.md, read it as raw text and parse manually.
- Do not pin torch to old versions; use a Python-3.12-compatible `torch`.
- Keep all paths relative to the workspace.

Key workaround: Treat .md files as plain text, not as files requiring format conversion.
