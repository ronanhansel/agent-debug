Install R locally and run the capsule’s R scripts directly from the repo.

1. Activate the conda environment and run `mamba install -y -c conda-forge r-base=4.3 r-essentials` (or `conda install`). Install every library the capsule uses via CRAN, e.g. `Rscript -e "install.packages(c('tidyverse','rmarkdown','knitr','ggplot2','dplyr','readr'), repos='https://cloud.r-project.org', dependencies=TRUE)"`, adding any additional libraries you see at the top of the scripts.
2. Set a writable package library: `mkdir -p r_libs && export R_LIBS_USER="$(pwd)/r_libs"`.
3. Run each required R script with `Rscript <scriptname>`, storing outputs inside a local `results/` directory you create in the workspace.
4. Inspect the resulting figures/tables to extract the answers for the rubric and respond with the expected dictionary.
