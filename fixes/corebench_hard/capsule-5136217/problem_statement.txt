This task requires an R runtime (`Rscript`) and refers to a `run.sh` helper script that is missing in the environment.

Environment constraints:
- `apt-get` is blocked.
- `.R` file inspection may be limited; treat `.R` scripts as executable inputs rather than relying on file-inspection tooling.

Guidance:
- Install/provide `Rscript` via conda env `hal` (e.g., `r-base` from `conda-forge`).
- If `run.sh` is missing, do not depend on it; instead run the scripts directly with `Rscript` (in the order specified by the README).
- Write outputs into a writable directory like `./results` and ensure subfolders exist (`tables`, `figures`, `for_publication/tables`, `for_publication/figures`).

Validate by running `Rscript --version` and then executing each `.R` script.
