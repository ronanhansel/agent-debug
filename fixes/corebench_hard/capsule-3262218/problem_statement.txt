If required tools for RMarkdown rendering are missing (R/Rscript, pandoc, LaTeX) or file inspection cannot handle .Rmd, do not attempt to install system deps. Instead:
- Detect missing executables and explain the limitation.
- If reading files fails due to I/O layer restrictions ("Not a regular file"), note that and proceed with best-effort guidance.
- Provide local steps to render manuscript.Rmd to PDF.
- Write any outputs only under $HAL_OUTPUT_DIR (default ./results).
