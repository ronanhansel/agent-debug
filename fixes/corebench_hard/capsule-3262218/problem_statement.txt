IMPORTANT ENVIRONMENT INSTRUCTIONS:

1. The R package 'papaja' is NOT AVAILABLE from conda-forge. Do NOT attempt to
   install it via conda - it will fail with PackagesNotFoundError.

2. The TeX Live installation is INCOMPLETE - missing essential components like
   'mktexlsr.pl'. PDF rendering via LaTeX will fail.

3. The Python csv module is RESTRICTED in the sandbox. Do not import csv.

4. Alternative approaches for manuscript rendering:

   a) If papaja is required and unavailable:
      - Report that computational reproduction is not possible due to missing
        'papaja' package which is not available in conda-forge
      - The manuscript cannot be rendered to PDF without papaja

   b) If you can render to HTML instead of PDF:
      Rscript -e "rmarkdown::render('manuscript.Rmd', output_format='html_document', output_dir='../results')"

   c) Extract key values from the Rmd file directly:
      - Read the .Rmd file as plain text using bash: cat manuscript.Rmd
      - Identify R code chunks with computations
      - Execute those R code chunks separately to get values

5. For file operations, use bash commands (cat, grep) instead of Python file I/O.

6. If the task requires specific numeric values from the manuscript:
   - Look for inline R code expressions like `r variable_name`
   - Find where those variables are computed in R code chunks
   - Run the computation code directly to get the values

7. Environment setup:
   conda activate hal
   # Do NOT attempt conda install for papaja or texlive

8. Output directory: Ensure outputs go to HAL_OUTPUT_DIR (../results).

Original task: Render the manuscript and extract required values.
