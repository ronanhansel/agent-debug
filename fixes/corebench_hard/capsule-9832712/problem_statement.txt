This task failed because `Rscript` is missing and system installs via `apt-get` are blocked.

Guidance:
- Do not use `apt-get`.
- Provide `Rscript` via conda in env `hal` (install `r-base` from `conda-forge`).
- Use a writable R library path (`R_LIBS_USER=./.R/library`) if packages need to be installed.

Before running `master_script.R`:
- Ensure required output subdirectories exist and are writable:
  - `01_scopus-selection/`
  - `02_coding/`
  - `03_analyses/`

Then run the pipeline using the conda-provided `Rscript`, and proceed to extract the required output values from the generated cleaned results.
