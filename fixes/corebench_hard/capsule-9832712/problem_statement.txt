This task failed because:
- Conda installation of r-base/pandoc was blocked by CondaToSNonInteractiveError (Terms of Service not accepted).
- Missing system header ft2build.h caused systemfonts compilation to fail.
- Binary incompatibility: undefined symbol 'R_getVarEx' in magrittr.so when loading tidyverse.

Guidance:
- Do NOT use `apt-get` or default conda channels.
- Use conda-forge channel exclusively (bypasses ToS gates and provides precompiled binaries).
- Install `r-base`, `r-tidyverse`, `r-magrittr`, `r-systemfonts`, `freetype`, `fontconfig`, and `pandoc` via conda-forge.
- All packages should be precompiled to avoid system header requirements.
- Set `R_LIBS_USER=./.R/library` for any additional R package installations.

Before running `master_script.R`:
- Ensure required output subdirectories exist and are writable:
  - `01_scopus-selection/`
  - `02_coding/`
  - `03_analyses/`
- Verify `Rscript --version` succeeds before running the pipeline.

The key is using conda-forge precompiled packages to avoid both ToS issues and compilation requirements.
