IMPORTANT ENVIRONMENT INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Conda installations are BLOCKED by Terms of Service:
   - CondaToSNonInteractiveError for https://repo.anaconda.com/pkgs/main
   - CondaToSNonInteractiveError for https://repo.anaconda.com/pkgs/r
   DO NOT attempt conda install commands - they will fail.

2. tidyverse is NOT AVAILABLE:
   - Error: "there is no package called 'tidyverse'"
   - Cannot be installed via conda due to ToS restrictions
   - CRAN installation may fail due to missing system headers

3. Results directories may be empty:
   - results/01_scopus-selection
   - results/02_coding
   - results/03_analyses
   These directories must be created and populated.

4. Alternative approaches:

   a) Create required directories first:
      mkdir -p results/01_scopus-selection results/02_coding results/03_analyses

   b) Check what R packages ARE installed:
      Rscript -e "installed.packages()[,'Package']"

   c) Use base R alternatives for tidyverse functions:
      - read.csv() instead of readr::read_csv()
      - subset(), merge() instead of dplyr functions
      - aggregate() for group operations
      - base R plotting instead of ggplot2

   d) If CRAN installation is possible:
      Rscript -e "install.packages('tidyverse', repos='https://cloud.r-project.org')"
      Note: This may still fail due to system header dependencies

   e) If tidyverse cannot be installed:
      - Modify master_script.R to use base R
      - Or report as environmental limitation

5. For master_script.R execution:
   - Ensure directories exist before running
   - Check library availability before loading
   - Use try() or tryCatch() for error handling

6. Environment:
   conda activate hal
   mkdir -p results/01_scopus-selection results/02_coding results/03_analyses
   # Do NOT run conda install

7. Output directory: Ensure results/ subdirectories exist and are writable.

Original task: Run master_script.R to produce analysis outputs.
