Before running any analysis scripts, ensure the R runtime is available.

Environment requirement:
- `Rscript` must be on `PATH` (e.g., install `r-base` via conda in the `hal` env).

Suggested setup commands (run once in the task environment):
- `conda activate hal`
- `conda install -y -c conda-forge r-base`
- `Rscript --version`

Then proceed with the task as written.
