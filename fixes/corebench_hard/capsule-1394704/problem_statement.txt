IMPORTANT ENVIRONMENT INSTRUCTIONS:

1. DO NOT attempt to install R packages via conda or CRAN. The conda Terms of Service
   restrictions and missing system build tools (freetype, cmake, libudunits2, rust)
   prevent package installation.

2. The required R packages (tidyverse and dependencies) should already be available
   in the pre-configured 'hal' conda environment. Use the existing R installation.

3. To render the R Markdown file, use:
   Rscript -e "rmarkdown::render('code/modular.Rmd', output_dir='../results')"

4. Ensure all outputs are written to the HAL_OUTPUT_DIR (../results directory).

5. If you encounter 'there is no package called X' errors, this is an environmental
   limitation. Do not attempt to install packages interactively.

6. Skip any package installation steps and proceed directly to rendering the Rmd file.

Original task: Render the modular.Rmd file and produce the required outputs.
