ENVIRONMENT SETUP (Pre-configured):
- R packages are pre-installed via conda (tidyverse, dplyr, ggplot2, rmarkdown, knitr, lme4, etc.)
- Bioconductor packages (GSVA) are available
- Use: conda activate agent
- R library path: ./.R/library

---
   restrictions and missing system build tools (freetype, cmake, libudunits2, rust)
   prevent package installation.

2. The required R packages (tidyverse and dependencies) should already be available
   in the pre-configured 'hal' conda environment. Use the existing R installation.

3. To render the R Markdown file, use:
   Rscript -e "rmarkdown::render('code/modular.Rmd', output_dir='../results')"

4. Ensure all outputs are written to the HAL_OUTPUT_DIR (../results directory).
6. Skip any package installation steps and proceed directly to rendering the Rmd file.

Original task: Render the modular.Rmd file and produce the required outputs.
