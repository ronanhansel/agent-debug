  "problem_statement": "IMPORTANT ENVIRONMENT INSTRUCTIONS:\n\n1. DO NOT attempt to install R packages via conda or CRAN. The conda Terms of Service restrictions and missing system build tools prevent package installation.\n\n2. The required R packages (tidyverse, etc.) should already be available in the pre-configured environment. If packages are missing, the task cannot be completed due to environmental constraints.\n\n3. To render the R Markdown file, use:\n   Rscript -e \"rmarkdown::render('code/modular.Rmd', output_dir='../results')\"\n\n4. Ensure all outputs are written to the HAL_OUTPUT_DIR (../results directory).\n\n5. If you encounter 'there is no package called X' errors, report this as an environmental limitation rather than attempting to install packages.\n\nOriginal task: Render the modular.Rmd file and produce the required outputs."
