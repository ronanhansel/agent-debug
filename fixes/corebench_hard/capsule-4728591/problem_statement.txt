Environment constraints:

CRITICAL ISSUES:
1. Conda TOS blocks default Anaconda channels: CondaToSNonInteractiveError
2. Rscript is not available (Exit Code 127)
3. R package 'stringr' is missing
4. R package 'bookdown' is required for the replication script

INSTRUCTIONS:
- Do NOT use `apt-get` (blocked).
- Use conda (env `base`) with conda-forge channel EXCLUSIVELY.
- The default Anaconda channels (pkgs/main, pkgs/r) require TOS acceptance - avoid them.

CONDA CHANNEL FIX:
The TOS error occurs with default Anaconda channels. Use conda-forge only:
```
conda install -c conda-forge r-base r-stringr r-bookdown r-rmarkdown r-knitr pandoc
```

SETUP:
1. Create writable R library directory:
   ```
   mkdir -p ./.R/library
   export R_LIBS_USER=./.R/library
   ```

2. Create results directory:
   ```
   mkdir -p ./results
   ```

3. Verify Rscript is available:
   ```
   Rscript --version
   ```

4. Verify stringr is loadable:
   ```
   Rscript -e "library(stringr); print('stringr OK')"
   ```

EXECUTION:
After setup, run the replication script:
```
Rscript tests/replicate.R
```

OUTPUT: Write all results to `./results` directory.
