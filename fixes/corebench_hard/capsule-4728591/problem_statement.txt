This task failed because `Rscript` and required R packages (notably `bookdown`) are missing.

Environment constraints:
- Do not use `apt-get`.
- Provide R + packages via conda in env `base`.
- The output directory referenced by the reproducibility script must exist and be writable.

Guidance:
- Install `r-base` and required packages (e.g., `r-bookdown`, `r-rmarkdown`, `r-knitr`) via `conda-forge`.
- Set `R_LIBS_USER=./.R/library` so any additional `install.packages()` calls succeed.
- Ensure outputs go to a writable directory (e.g., `./results`) and create needed subdirs before running.
- Then run `Rscript tests/replicate.R`.
