IMPORTANT ENVIRONMENT INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Rscript may NOT be installed:
   - Exit code 127 indicates Rscript is not in PATH
   - Check if R is available: which Rscript or which R
   - If not available, report as environmental limitation

2. Conda installations are BLOCKED by Terms of Service:
   - CondaToSNonInteractiveError for https://repo.anaconda.com/pkgs/main
   - CondaToSNonInteractiveError for https://repo.anaconda.com/pkgs/r
   DO NOT attempt conda install commands - they will fail.

3. Replication data files are MISSING:
   - replication_data/node_attributes.rda - NOT FOUND
   - Other .rda files in replication_data/ may also be missing
   - Error: 'cannot open the connection' when loading these files

4. Alternative approaches:

   a) Check if R is installed:
      which Rscript
      Rscript --version

   b) If R is available but data files missing:
      - List what files exist: ls -la replication_data/
      - Report missing data artifacts as environmental limitation
      - The analysis cannot be completed without the .rda files

   c) If running tests/replicate.R:
      - Check if file exists: ls -la tests/replicate.R
      - If data files are missing, the script will fail
      - Report this clearly rather than attempting execution

5. Environment setup:
   conda activate hal
   # Do NOT run conda install - it will fail due to ToS

6. If you must simulate output:
   - Acknowledge that replication_data/*.rda files are missing
   - Report that the replication script cannot complete
   - Provide explanation of what the script would compute

7. Output directory: HAL_OUTPUT_DIR (../results).

Original task: Run the R replication script using the provided data files.
