  "problem_statement": "IMPORTANT ENVIRONMENT INSTRUCTIONS:\n\n1. DO NOT attempt to install R packages via conda. The conda Terms of Service restrictions prevent package installation:\n   - CondaToSNonInteractiveError for https://repo.anaconda.com/pkgs/main\n   - CondaToSNonInteractiveError for /pkgs/r\n\n2. The conda environment at /opt/conda/envs/agent_env may not be valid (DirectoryNotACondaEnvironmentError). Use the 'hal' conda environment instead.\n\n3. Required R data files may be missing:\n   - ../data/Luminal_Basal_Gene_Sets.RData\n   - Other .Rda files referenced in scripts\n\n4. If data files are missing:\n   - Check the actual data directory structure: ls -la ../data/ or ls -la data/\n   - Look for alternative data file locations\n   - If data truly doesn't exist, report this as an environmental constraint\n\n5. GSVA package alternatives:\n   - If GSVA is not available, the analysis cannot proceed as designed\n   - Report unavailable packages rather than attempting installation\n\n6. Environment setup:\n   - Activate the 'hal' conda environment: conda activate hal\n   - Use R from that environment\n\n7. Ensure outputs go to HAL_OUTPUT_DIR (../results).\n\nOriginal task: Run the R pipeline using GSVA for gene set analysis."
