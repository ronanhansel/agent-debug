`main.R` can’t run because Rscript is missing. Install R inside conda, ensure the requested default packages are exported, then execute the script.

1. From the repo root, run `mamba install -y -c conda-forge r-base=4.3 r-essentials` (or `conda install` if mamba isn’t present). Install the packages that `main.R` loads with CRAN, e.g. `Rscript -e "install.packages(c('tidyverse','limma','GSVA','ggplot2','dplyr','readr'), repos='https://cloud.r-project.org', dependencies=TRUE)"`, adding any additional libraries you see at the top of the script.
2. Export the default package list the capsule calls out before running: `export R_DEFAULT_PACKAGES="datasets,utils,grDevices,graphics,stats,methods"`.
3. Run the analysis via `Rscript main.R` (or whatever working directory the capsule expects). When it completes, inspect the resulting plots/tables to identify which group has the highest median GSVA score for the CTCF Signature Enrichment figure, and use that value in the final answer.
