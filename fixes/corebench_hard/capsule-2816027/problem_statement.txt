Environment prerequisite:

CRITICAL ISSUE:
- R package 'GSVA' is missing and cannot be installed via standard methods.
- Error: 'there is no package called GSVA'
- BiocManager installation fails with HTTP 404 errors.
- Conda default channels are blocked by TOS restrictions.

INSTRUCTIONS:
- `Rscript` must be available (do not use `apt-get`).
- Use conda in env `base` with conda-forge AND bioconda channels to provide `r-base` and Bioconductor packages.

GSVA INSTALLATION STRATEGY:
1. Try conda with bioconda channel: `conda install -c bioconda bioconductor-gsva`
2. If that fails, try BiocManager with a specific mirror:
   ```R
   if (!require("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
       install.packages("BiocManager", repos="https://cloud.r-project.org")
   BiocManager::install("GSVA", ask=FALSE, update=FALSE)
   ```
3. If GSVA cannot be installed at all:
   - Check if the analysis can proceed with GSVA-related code commented out.
   - Document which results cannot be generated due to missing GSVA.

WORKAROUND IF GSVA UNAVAILABLE:
- Modify main.R to wrap GSVA-dependent code in tryCatch blocks.
- Output a clear message indicating GSVA analysis was skipped.
- Continue with any non-GSVA analysis portions.

EXECUTION:
After ensuring `Rscript --version` works, run `main.R` with `Rscript` as the task requires.
Ensure `R_DEFAULT_PACKAGES` remains set to `datasets,utils,grDevices,graphics,stats,methods` if relied upon.

OUTPUT: Write all results to ./results directory.
