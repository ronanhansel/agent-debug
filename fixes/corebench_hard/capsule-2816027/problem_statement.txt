If Rscript is missing and cannot be installed (no permissions/network), do not attempt apt-get. Instead:
- Detect missing Rscript and explain the limitation.
- Provide best-effort instructions to run main.R locally and list required packages.
- Write any outputs only under $HAL_OUTPUT_DIR (default ./results).
