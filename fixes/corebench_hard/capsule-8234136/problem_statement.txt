Environment constraints:

CRITICAL ISSUES:
1. Network download of Bitbrain dataset FAILS with TimeoutError
2. wget.download(url) causes URLError when trying to fetch external dataset
3. FileNotFoundError when accessing expected dataset CSV files after download fails
4. matplotlib==3.3.2 pinned version cannot be built

INSTRUCTIONS:
- Do NOT use `apt-get` (blocked).
- Use conda (env `base`) with conda-forge channel.
- Do NOT pin matplotlib to version 3.3.2 - use a compatible version.

NETWORK DOWNLOAD FIX (CRITICAL):
The code tries to download the Bitbrain dataset from the internet, which TIMES OUT.
The download in BitbrainWorkload2.py will FAIL. You must:

1. Check if dataset already exists locally before downloading
2. If download fails, check for existing data files in:
   - ./data/
   - ./Bitbrain/
   - Any other data directory

3. Modify the download logic to handle TimeoutError gracefully:
   ```python
   try:
       wget.download(url)
   except Exception as e:
       print(f"Download failed: {e}")
       # Check for local data instead
   ```

4. If no local data exists and download fails, the script should:
   - Report that the dataset is unavailable
   - Exit gracefully with informative error message
   - Do NOT hang indefinitely on network timeout

OFFLINE MODE:
Set BITBRAIN_OFFLINE_MODE=true in environment to signal offline operation.
The code should check this environment variable and skip network downloads.

MATPLOTLIB FIX:
Do NOT use pinned version matplotlib==3.3.2. Install current version:
```
pip install matplotlib joblib
```

Use headless backend: `export MPLBACKEND=Agg`

EXECUTION:
After dependencies are installed and data handling is fixed:
```
python main.py
python grapher.py
```

OUTPUT: Write all results to `./results` directory.
