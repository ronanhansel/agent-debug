This task failed because `matplotlib==3.3.2` could not be built in this environment, causing missing `matplotlib` and `joblib`.

Guidance:
- Do not pin to `matplotlib==3.3.2`.
- Install a compatible prebuilt `matplotlib` wheel (or conda-provided matplotlib) and ensure `joblib` is installed.
- Use headless plotting: set `MPLBACKEND=Agg`.
- Ensure outputs/logs go to a writable directory (e.g., `./results`).

After dependencies install cleanly, rerun `main.py` and `grapher.py` to generate outputs.
