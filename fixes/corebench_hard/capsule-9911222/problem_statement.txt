This task failed because:
- Conda installation was blocked by CondaToSNonInteractiveError (Terms of Service not accepted for default channels).
- Compilation of OncoBird R package failed due to missing `pkg-config` system tool.
- The vignette failed when calling `library(OncoBird)` because the package was not installed correctly.

Guidance:
- Do NOT use `apt-get` or default conda channels.
- Use conda-forge and bioconda channels exclusively (bypasses ToS gates).
- Install via conda-forge:
  - `r-base` (4.x)
  - `pandoc`
  - `texlive-core` (TeX toolchain)
  - `r-rmarkdown`, `r-knitr`, `r-matrix`, `r-mass`
  - `pkg-config` (critical for building OncoBird)
- Set `R_LIBS_USER=./.R/library` for R package installations.
- For Bioconductor packages (e.g., ComplexHeatmap), use `BiocManager::install()` into the R_LIBS_USER directory.

To build and render:
1. Ensure pkg-config is available: `which pkg-config`
2. Install OncoBird: `R CMD INSTALL OncoBird`
3. Render vignette:
   `Rscript -e "rmarkdown::render('OncoBird/vignettes/OncoBird.Rmd', output_format='pdf_document', output_dir='./results', clean=TRUE)"`
4. If pdflatex is missing, use: `Rscript -e "tinytex::install_tinytex()"`

The output directory should be `./results` (not `../results`).
