This task failed due to missing/incompatible dependencies:
- `networkx` was missing.
- The installed `network_diffusion` package does not provide required classes (`MultiSpreading`, `PropagationModel`).

Guidance:
- Install `networkx`.
- If `network_diffusion` still lacks the required API, do not attempt web search. Instead:
  - Vendor a minimal local implementation (or compatibility shim) that provides the missing classes used by `epidemic.py`, OR
  - Adjust the code to avoid importing those classes if they are not actually needed for producing the required plots/outputs.

Use headless plotting (`MPLBACKEND=Agg`). If the task requires reporting plot metadata (titles/line colors), add a small code path that prints/saves those details in plain text.
