CRITICAL ISSUES:
1. Sandbox BLOCKS imports: 'Import of os is not allowed', 'Import of pandas is not allowed'
2. ModuleNotFoundError for 'network_diffusion' - PYTHONPATH issue
3. Missing dependencies: networkx and dynetx are not installed
4. Local vendored module 'network_diffusion' is not found due to path issues

INSTRUCTIONS:
- Do NOT use `apt-get` (blocked).
- Use conda (env `base`) with conda-forge channel.
- Do NOT use 'import os' or 'import pandas' in agent debugging code - they are blocked by sandbox.

SANDBOX IMPORT RESTRICTIONS:
The sandbox blocks certain imports. If you see errors like:
- "Import of os is not allowed"
- "Import of pandas is not allowed"

These are sandbox restrictions, NOT missing packages. Do NOT try to install os/pandas.
The main script (epidemic.py) may be allowed to use these - the restriction applies to agent code.

PYTHONPATH FIX (CRITICAL):
The 'network_diffusion' module is vendored locally but not found.
Set PYTHONPATH to include the vendored directory:
```
export PYTHONPATH="./network_diffusion:$PYTHONPATH"
```

Or if running epidemic.py:
```
PYTHONPATH=./network_diffusion python epidemic.py
```

DEPENDENCY INSTALLATION:
```
pip install networkx dynetx matplotlib
```

VERIFICATION:
After setting PYTHONPATH, verify imports work:
```
PYTHONPATH=./network_diffusion python -c "import network_diffusion; print('OK')"
```

HEADLESS PLOTTING:
Use headless backend for matplotlib:
```
export MPLBACKEND=Agg
```

EXECUTION:
```
PYTHONPATH=./network_diffusion MPLBACKEND=Agg python epidemic.py
```

OUTPUT: Write all results to `./results` directory.
