Environment prerequisites and filesystem constraints:

CRITICAL ISSUES:
1. CMake is missing - required for building some R packages from source.
2. Conda TOS blocks default channels - must use conda-forge.
3. R packages nloptr, lme4, ez, and smoother require compilation tools.

INSTRUCTIONS:
- Do not write to `../results` (parent directory is not writable). Use `./results` (or `HAL_OUTPUT_DIR`) instead.
- Do not use `apt-get` (blocked in this environment).
- R must be available (`Rscript` on PATH) and required R packages must be pre-installed.

DEPENDENCY STRATEGY:
- Use conda (env `base`) with conda-forge channel to install pre-compiled R packages.
- Install required R packages via conda when possible:
  - r-rmarkdown, r-knitr, r-readr, r-kableextra
  - r-nloptr, r-lme4, r-ez (these require compilation tools if not from conda)
- Do NOT call install.packages() for packages requiring compilation - they will fail without build tools.
- If a package is unavailable, check if there's a conda-forge binary version.

FOR SMOOTHER PACKAGE:
- If r-smoother is not available via conda, try CRAN as it may have a pure-R fallback.
- Alternatively, check if the analysis can proceed without it.

EXECUTION:
After the above dependencies are resolved, render the available `.Rmd` files into HTML, writing outputs into `./results`.
