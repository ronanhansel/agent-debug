Environment constraints:
- Do not use `apt-get` (blocked).
- Provide R + pandoc + LaTeX via conda in env `base`.
- Do not write to parent directories; write outputs to a writable directory like `./results`.

If `preregSR_manuscript.Rmd` is missing from the workspace, the rendering step cannot run. In that case:
- Fail fast with a clear message that the repository content is missing.
- Do not attempt OS-level cloning or system installs.

If the file exists, render it using conda-provided `Rscript`/`pandoc`/TeX into `./results`.
