Environment constraints:

CRITICAL ISSUES:
1. Missing file: 'preregSR_manuscript.Rmd' is not found in the workspace.
2. R package 'meta' cannot be loaded (library(meta) fails).
3. Conda TOS blocks default Anaconda channels - use conda-forge.

INSTRUCTIONS:
- Do not use `apt-get` (blocked).
- Provide R + pandoc + LaTeX via conda in env `base` using conda-forge channel.
- Do not write to parent directories; write outputs to a writable directory like `./results`.

HANDLING MISSING RMD FILE:
If `preregSR_manuscript.Rmd` is missing from the workspace:
1. First, search for any .Rmd files that may exist in the workspace.
2. If the file is genuinely missing (not in any subdirectory), produce a clear error message:
   "ERROR: preregSR_manuscript.Rmd not found in workspace. Cannot proceed with rendering."
3. Do not attempt OS-level cloning or system installs to obtain it.

HANDLING META PACKAGE:
The 'meta' R package is required. Try installing via:
- conda: `conda install -c conda-forge r-meta` (preferred)
- If conda fails, try: `install.packages("meta", repos="https://cloud.r-project.org")`
- The 'metafor' package may be an alternative if 'meta' is unavailable.

EXECUTION:
If the Rmd file exists and dependencies are resolved, render it using conda-provided `Rscript`/`pandoc`/TeX into `./results`.
