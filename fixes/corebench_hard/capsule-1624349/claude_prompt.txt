You are diagnosing and fixing an environmental barrier in a CoreBench evaluation task.

## CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS - READ CAREFULLY

1. **FIX ENVIRONMENTAL BARRIERS ONLY** - Do NOT make the question easier or change its core challenge
2. **PRESERVE DIFFICULTY** - The task should remain as difficult as originally intended
3. **NO NERFING** - Do not:
   - Simplify the question
   - Give hints about the answer
   - Reduce computational requirements
   - Remove necessary steps
   - Pre-compute results for the agent
4. **VALID FIXES INCLUDE**:
   - Clarifying ambiguous instructions (without giving away answers)
   - Fixing missing environment dependencies that SHOULD be present
   - Correcting typos or unclear wording in task description
   - Ensuring required data files are accessible
   - Fixing permission issues that shouldn't exist
5. **INVALID FIXES** (DO NOT DO):
   - Adding answer hints
   - Pre-installing packages the agent should install itself
   - Simplifying the computational task
   - Reducing the scope of what needs to be done

**Benchmark**: corebench_hard

## RUBRIC EVALUATION RESULTS


Score: 1.0 (1.0 = Environmental Barrier, 0.0 = Capability Issue)
Models that succeeded: None
Models that failed: gpt-4.1-04-14, o3-04-16, o4-mini-04-16, o4-mini-04-16

Rubric Explanation:
The transcript shows two infrastructure-level blocks that prevent executing the notebook and extracting results as required.

1) Sandboxed Python interpreter forbids required imports to execute notebooks in-memory:
- Error: "InterpreterError: Import of nbformat is not allowed. Authorized imports are: ['itertools', 'math', 'random', ...]" when the agent tries `import nbformat` (and similarly would block `nbclient`). This is a sandbox restriction on essential operations for programmatic notebook execution within the provided `python_interpreter` tool.

2) The normal workaround—running `nbconvert` via shell—also fails because `nbconvert` is not available to the environment’s Python at execution time:
- Despite attempting `pip install jupyter nbconvert`, later execution fails with: "/home/agent/miniconda3/envs/agent_env/bin/python: No module named nbconvert".
- Because `nbconvert` cannot be imported by the runtime used for `python -m nbconvert`, the notebook cannot be executed to HTML as the task requires. As a consequence, downstream greps fail: "grep: ../results/FS-Filters.html: No such file or directory".

Given these constraints, the required action (“Execute 'FS-Filters.ipynb'… Save the results in html”) is mechanically blocked: the sandbox disallows the libraries needed for in-interpreter execution, and the system-level execution path cannot access `nbconvert` in the Python environment actually used.

The agent’s final error converting to float is secondary; the core failure is inability to produce the executed HTML output at all.

Cross-Model Reasoning:
The cross-model summary indicates all 4 models failed. In this specific transcript, the failures are consistent with a platform restriction rather than reasoning: (a) imports required for notebook execution are explicitly disallowed in the sandboxed interpreter, and (b) `python -m nbconvert` cannot run because `nbconvert` is missing from the runtime Python. These are not typical "try a different command" issues if the environment cannot ever provide a working nbconvert/nbformat path. The repeated, consistent inability to execute the notebook across models supports an environmental barrier hypothesis rather than coincidental agent mistakes.

Now write your updated facts below, taking into account the above history:
## 1. Updated facts survey
### 1.1. Facts given in the task
### 1.2. Facts that we have learned
### 1.3. Facts still to look up
### 1.4. Facts still to derive

Then write a step-by-step high-level plan to solve the task above.
## 2. Plan
### 2. 1. ...
Etc.
This plan should involve individual tasks based on the available tools, that if executed correctly will yield the correct answer.
Beware that you have {remaining_steps} steps remaining.
Do not skip steps, do not add any superfluous steps. Only write the high-level plan, DO NOT DETAIL INDIVIDUAL TOOL CALLS.
After writing the final step of the plan, write the '\n<end_plan>' tag and stop there.

You can leverage these tools, behaving like regular python functions:
```python

    """Performs a google web search for your query then returns a string of the top search results.

[assistant]: ## 1. Updated facts survey

### 1.1. Facts given in the task
- The repository contains code from a scientific paper.
- The goal is to test computational reproducibility by executing `FS-Filters.ipynb`.
- Output (in HTML format) should be saved in `../results` (but permissions only allow `./results`).
- All runs should disable cell execution timeout and allow errors.
- Two questions must be answered from the repository output:
    1. "Report the best accuracy of the hybrid filter wrapper strategy."
    2. "fig Report the name of the feature with the highest I-Gain."
- All dependencies should be installed as indicated in the Readme.

### 1.2. Facts that we have learned
- `requirements.txt` is present and lists dependencies (no scikit-learn, numpy, etc. directly, which seems odd for filters/FS, so may be missing some packages if needed by notebook).
- The correct notebook path is: `./environment/code/FS-Filters.ipynb`.
- `../results` cannot be created due to permissions. We have created (or can create) `./results` and should use it instead.
- `jupyter` is not installed, contributing to the failed attempt to convert/execute the notebook.
- All other prerequisites from requirements.txt are satisfied or previously installed.

### 1.3. Facts still to look up
- Whether `FS-Filters.ipynb` references any additional requirements.
- Whether running the notebook in-place (outputting to `./results`) will suffice.
- What code/content is present in the output HTML to extract answers for the two key questions.

### 1.4. Facts still to derive
- The best accuracy value for the hybrid filter wrapper strategy (from the run/output).
- The name of the feature with the highest I-Gain (from either run/output or logic inside the notebook).

## 2. Plan

### 2.1. Install jupyter and any other notebook-related runtime as needed.
### 2.2. Run `FS-Filters.ipynb` using jupyter nbconvert, with timeout disabled and errors allowed, saving output to `./results/FS-Filters_out.html`.
### 2.3. Read the r

[assistant]: I still need to solve the task I was given:
```
Task: codeocean_hard

Your goal is to test the computational reproducibility of the repository cloned to your current directory, which is code from a scientific paper. Specifically, you need to Execute 'FS-Filters.ipynb'. Save the results in html format in ../results. For all the runs, disable the cell execution timeout and allow errors. to answer the following questions: dict_keys(['Report the best accuracy of the hybrid filter wrapper strategy.', 'fig Report the name of the feature with the highest I-Gain.']). Your submitted answer should be a Python dictionary whose keys are exactly those questions and values are the answers. You should install all of the requirements found in the Readme file and then run the commands necessary to answer the questions.
```

Here are the facts I know and my new/updated plan of action to solve the task:
```
## 1. Updated facts survey
### 1.1. Facts given in the task
- We must test computational reproducibility of the repository already cloned.
- We need to execute `FS-Filters.ipynb` (located in `environment/code/`).
- Execution requirements: allow errors, no per-cell timeout.
- We must save the executed notebook as HTML in `../results`.
- From the run we have to answer two questions exactly:
  1. ‘Report the best accuracy of the hybrid filter wrapper strategy.’
  2. ‘fig Report the name of the feature with the highest I-Gain.’
- Final submission must be a Python dictionary mapping those exact keys to the answers.

### 1.2. Facts that we have learned
- Repository structure shows the notebook in `environment/code/FS-Filters.ipynb`.
- A `README.md` in that folder explains this notebook covers I-Gain and Chi-square filters.
- There are other notebooks (Wrappers, etc.) but only FS-Filters is required.
- No environment.yml; dependencies will mostly be `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, etc., which are usually pre-installed or can be pip-installed.
- The task’s earlier failure

[assistant]: ## 1. Updated facts survey
### 1.1. Facts given in the task
- We must test computational reproducibility of the repository already cloned.
- We need to execute `FS-Filters.ipynb` (located in `environment/code/`).
- Execution requirements: allow errors, no per-cell timeout.
- We must save the executed notebook as HTML in `../results`.
- From the run we have to answer two questions exactly:
  1. ‘Report the best accuracy of the hybrid filter wrapper strategy.’
  2. ‘fig Report the name of the feature with the highest I-Gain.’
- Final submission must be a Python dictionary mapping those exact keys to the answers.

### 1.2. Facts that we have learned
- Repository structure shows the notebook in `environment/code/FS-Filters.ipynb`.
- A `README.md` in that folder explains this notebook covers I-Gain and Chi-square filters.
- There are other notebooks (Wrappers, etc.) but only FS-Filters is required.
- No environment.yml; dependencies will mostly be `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, etc., which are usually pre-installed or can be pip-installed.
- The task’s earlier failure was only formatting; no actual execution has yet been done.

### 1.3. Facts still to look up
- Which Python packages are imported in `FS-Filters.ipynb` (to be installed if missing).
- After executing the notebook, what number is printed/displayed for the hybrid filter-wrapper strategy’s best accuracy.
- Which feature has the highest Information Gain (I-Gain) in the notebook output.

### 1.4. Facts still to derive
- Exact numeric value of the best hybrid strategy accuracy.
- Exact feature name with highest I-Gain.
- Compose the required answer dictionary.

## 2. Plan
### 2.1. Inspect `FS-Filters.ipynb` quickly (JSON search) to anticipate required packages and the output labels to parse.
### 2.2. Install any missing Python packages (using pip) that the notebook imports but may not yet exist.
### 2.3. Execute the notebook with `jupyter nbconvert --to html --execute --ExecutePreprocessor.timeo

[assistant]: Thought: The previous code failed because writing files via `open` was forbidden. I'll simplify: install directly from the existing `requirements.txt`, execute the notebook with corrected nbconvert flags, then use bash `grep` and `sed` to extract the two required metrics from the HTML.

Code:
```py
# Step 1: Install dependencies directly from existing requirements.txt
install_log = execute_bash(command="pip install -r requirements.txt")
print("PIP INSTALL LOG:\n", install_log)

# Step 2: Ensure results directory exists
execute_bash(command="mkdir -p ../results")

# Step 3: Execute the notebook disabling timeout and allowing errors
# Use --output-dir instead of --output for path
exec_cmd = (
    "jupyter nbconvert "
    "--to html "
    "--execute environment/code/FS-Filters.ipynb "
    "--ExecutePreprocessor.timeout=-1 "
    "--ExecutePreprocessor.allow_errors=True "
    "--output FS-Filters.html "
    "--output-dir ../results"
)
nbconvert_log = execute_bash(command=exec_cmd)
print("NBConvert Log:\n", nbconvert_log)

# Step 4: Extract best hybrid filter-wrapper accuracy from HTML
# Look for lines containing 'hybrid' and a floating number, extract numbers, pick max
grep_hybrid = execute_bash(command=(
    "grep -iEo 'hybrid[^<]*[0-9]+\\.[0-9]+' ../results/FS-Filters.html | "
    "grep -Eo '[0-9]+\\.[0-9]+'"
))
print("Hybrid accuracy candidates:\n", grep_hybrid)
# Use python to select max
max_hybrid = python_interpreter(code=f"""
import re
numbers = re.findall(r"[0-9]+\\.[0-9]+", '''{grep_hybrid}''')
numbers = [float(n) for n in numbers]
print(max(numbers) if numbers else None)
""")

# Step 5: Extract feature with highest I-Gain
# Assume HTML table rows like <tr><td>FeatureName</td><td>0.123</td>
grep_igain = execute_bash(command=(
    "grep -oP '<tr>\\s*<td>[^<]+</td>\\s*<td>[0-9]+\\.[0-9]+' ../results/FS-Filters.html"
))
print("I-Gain rows:\n", grep_igain)
# Use python to parse and select the feature with max gain
max_feature = python_interpreter(code=f'''

[assistant]: I still need to solve the task I was given:
```
Task: codeocean_hard

Your goal is to test the computational reproducibility of the repository cloned to your current directory, which is code from a scientific paper. Specifically, you need to Execute 'FS-Filters.ipynb'. Save the results in html format in ../results. For all the runs, disable the cell execution timeout and allow errors. to answer the following questions: dict_keys(['Report the best accuracy of the hybrid filter wrapper strategy.', 'fig Report the name of the feature with the highest I-Gain.']). Your submitted answer should be a Python dictionary whose keys are exactly those questions and values are the answers. You should install all of the requirements found in the Readme file and then run the commands necessary to answer the questions.

## YOUR MISSION

1. **DIAGNOSE**: Analyze the rubric results and conversation logs to understand:
   - What environmental barrier(s) exist?
   - Why did the models fail?
   - Is this truly an environmental issue or a capability issue?

2. **INVESTIGATE**:
   - Look at the capsule/task files if needed
   - Check what the task is actually asking
   - Understand what the correct environment setup should be

3. **DETERMINE FIX TYPE**:

   **Type A - Environment Fix** (env_override.json):
   - Missing system packages that SHOULD be pre-installed
   - Missing R runtime for R-based tasks
   - Broken conda environment
   - Permission issues

   **Type B - Prompt/Input Fix** (input_override.json):
   - Ambiguous or unclear task instructions
   - Missing context that agents need
   - Typos or errors in the question
   - Misleading wording

   **Type C - No Fix Needed**:
   - The failure is actually a capability issue (agent should have been able to solve it)
   - The task is working as intended

4. **CREATE FIX** (if needed):
   - Create the fix in: fixes/corebench_hard/capsule-1624349/
   - For env fixes: env_override.json with HAL_CONDA_PACKAGES, etc.
   - For input fixes: input_override.json with clarified instructions
   - Write a README.md explaining what was fixed and why

5. **DOCUMENT**:
   - Explain your diagnosis
   - Justify why this fix is appropriate
   - Confirm the fix does NOT nerf the question

## BEGIN ANALYSIS

Start by reading the task files and understanding what this task requires.
Then diagnose the issue and create an appropriate fix (or determine no fix is needed).

Remember: Your goal is to make the evaluation FAIR, not EASY.
