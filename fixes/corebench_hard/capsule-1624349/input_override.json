  "problem_statement": "CRITICAL ENVIRONMENT INSTRUCTIONS:\n\n1. The sandbox environment RESTRICTS the following Python operations:\n   - DO NOT import 'os' or 'subprocess' modules\n   - DO NOT use the 'open()' function for file I/O\n   - DO NOT attempt direct file read/write operations\n\n2. Instead of writing files, return results directly as output text.\n\n3. For any data processing, use in-memory operations and print results to stdout.\n\n4. If you need to execute code, use the provided python_interpreter tool but avoid:\n   - File system operations\n   - System calls\n   - Importing restricted modules\n\n5. The output directory may be a symlink - use /tmp/hal_output for any necessary file operations if they become unblocked.\n\n6. Capture and return execution results as text rather than saving to files.\n\nOriginal task: Complete the notebook execution and return the required outputs as text."
