ENVIRONMENT SETUP (Pre-configured):
- R packages are pre-installed via conda (tidyverse, dplyr, ggplot2, rmarkdown, knitr, lme4, etc.)
- Bioconductor packages (GSVA) are available
- Use: conda activate agent
- R library path: ./.R/library

---

CRITICAL ENVIRONMENT INSTRUCTIONS:

1. The sandbox environment RESTRICTS the following Python operations:
   - DO NOT import 'os' or 'subprocess' modules - they are forbidden
   - DO NOT use the 'open()' function for file I/O - it is blocked
   - DO NOT attempt direct file read/write operations

2. Alternative approaches:
   - Return results directly as output text instead of writing files
   - Use in-memory operations for data processing
   - Print results to stdout for capture

3. For any data processing:
   - Use pandas/numpy for in-memory data manipulation if available
   - Avoid file system dependencies
   - Output results as formatted text

4. If executing Python code:
   - Use the python_interpreter tool
   - Avoid file system operations
   - Avoid system calls
   - Do not import restricted modules (os, subprocess, etc.)

5. File output considerations:
   - The ../results directory may be a symlink causing inspection failures
   - Use /tmp/hal_output if file operations become available
   - Prefer returning text output over file writing

6. To complete the task:
   - Process data in memory
   - Return computed results as formatted text
   - Do not rely on file I/O for the final answer

Original task: Complete the notebook execution and return the required outputs.
