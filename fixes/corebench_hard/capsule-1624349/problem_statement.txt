Environment prerequisites and filesystem constraints:

CRITICAL HARNESS REQUIREMENTS:
1. The evaluation harness requires output in a SINGLE code block wrapped in ```python and ```.
2. Tool-call limits are enforced - minimize the number of tool invocations.
3. README.md files may fail to process (UnsupportedFormatException) - avoid inspecting .md files.

INSTRUCTIONS:
- Do not write to `../results` (parent directory is not writable). Use `./results` (or `HAL_OUTPUT_DIR`) instead.
- Ensure the Python environment has notebook execution/export tooling:
  - `nbconvert`, `jupyter`, `jupyter_core`, and `ipykernel` must be importable.
- Ensure `scikit-learn` is installed (the notebook imports `sklearn`).

OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENT:
When providing code solutions, always output a SINGLE code block like:
```python
# Your complete solution code here
```

Do NOT:
- Include multiple code blocks
- Use excessive tool calls (stay under quota limits)
- Try to read/inspect .md files (will cause UnsupportedFormatException)

After dependencies are present, re-run the notebook export/execution, writing the generated HTML (and any artifacts) into `./results`.
