Environment prerequisites and filesystem constraints:

- Do not write to `../results` (parent directory is not writable). Use `./results` (or `HAL_OUTPUT_DIR`) instead.
- Ensure the Python environment has notebook execution/export tooling.
  - `nbconvert`, `jupyter`, `jupyter_core`, and `ipykernel` must be importable.
- Ensure `scikit-learn` is installed (the notebook imports `sklearn`).

After dependencies are present, re-run the notebook export/execution, writing the generated HTML (and any artifacts) into `./results`.
