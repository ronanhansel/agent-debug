If required Python dependencies are missing and cannot be installed (no network), avoid failing imports. Instead:
- Detect missing libraries (e.g., sklearn) and explain the limitation.
- Provide best-effort guidance to run the notebook locally with the needed dependencies.
- Write any outputs only under the directory specified by $HAL_OUTPUT_DIR (default ./results).
