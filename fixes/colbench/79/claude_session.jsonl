Let me provide a summary of the analysis and fixes:\n\n## Summary\n\nI've analyzed all 8 tasks (79, 80, 81, 82, 90, 93, 95, 98) for both backend and frontend versions. Here's the summary:\n\n### Fixes Created:\n\n| Task | Fix Type | Description |\n|------|----------|-------------|\n| **79** | README only | No fix needed - backend issues are inconsistent simulated user behavior (runs can succeed); frontend issues are infrastructure-level parser mismatch |\n| **80** | `instruction_override.json` | Backend: Added explicit schema clarification for `people_data` and `preferences` parameter formats to prevent simulated user's conflicting schema descriptions |\n| **81** | README only | No fix needed - backend works correctly; frontend has infrastructure issues |\n| **82** | README only | No fix needed - backend works correctly; frontend has infrastructure issues |\n| **90** | README only | No fix needed - backend works correctly; frontend has infrastructure issues |\n| **93** | README only | No fix needed - backend works correctly; frontend has infrastructure issues |\n| **95** | README only | No fix needed - backend is solvable when simulated user extracts info; frontend has infrastructure issues |\n| **98** | `simulated_user_override.json` | Backend: Fixed simulated user to provide the specific weighting coefficients (2, 3, 5) that are in the hidden code but user was saying \"I don't know\" |\n\n### Key Findings:\n\n1. **Frontend Tasks (all)**: There's a systematic infrastructure-level issue where:\n   - The parser enforces a Python fenced-code regex on HTML tasks\n   - The simulated user visual comparison system is broken (claims it can't see images, provides contradictory feedback)\n   - These require fixes in `hal-harness/hal/benchmarks/colbench.py` or the agent environment, NOT task-level fixes\n\n2. **Backend Tasks**:\n   - Most backend tasks work correctly when the simulated user successfully extracts information from the hidden code\n   - Task 80 and 98 have clear IFEs where the simulated user fails to convey critical implementation details\n   - Task 98 is the clearest IFE - the user explicitly says \"I don't know the weightings\" even though the hidden code has exact coefficients\n\n3. **Principle Applied**: Following \"make evaluation FAIR, not EASY\":\n   - Fixes clarify data formats or enable user to communicate existing hidden info\n   - Fixes do NOT reveal solution logic or simplify the task\n   - Fixes preserve the collaborative challenge while making information discovery possible","session_id":"e6f56bac-426a-49c3-92c5-9c88ea6787d2","total_cost_usd":2.2888442499999995,"usage":{"input_tokens":2,"cache_creation_input_tokens":87549,"cache_read_input_tokens":2844280,"output_tokens":12113,"server_tool_use":{"web_search_requests":0,"web_fetch_requests":0},"service_tier":"standard","cache_creation":{"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":87549}},"modelUsage":{"claude-opus-4-5-20251101":{"inputTokens":2,"outputTokens":12113,"cacheReadInputTokens":2844280,"cacheCreationInputTokens":87549,"webSearchRequests":0,"costUSD":2.2721562499999997,"contextWindow":200000,"maxOutputTokens":64000},"claude-haiku-4-5-20251001":{"inputTokens":13568,"outputTokens":624,"cacheReadInputTokens":0,"cacheCreationInputTokens":0,"webSearchRequests":0,"costUSD":0.016688,"contextWindow":200000,"maxOutputTokens":64000}},"permission_denials":[],"uuid":"91b8e526-fc41-4b05-9c33-8a83ccf445cf"}
