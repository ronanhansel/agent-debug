Let me provide a summary of the work completed:\n\n## Summary of ColBench IFE Fixes\n\nI've analyzed and created fixes for all 10 tasks (391, 396, 419, 448, 460, 467, 473, 476, 482, 493). Each task had a clear Intrinsic Formation Error where the hidden reference solution could not be discovered through the collaborative dialogue.\n\n### Common IFE Patterns Found:\n\n1. **Arbitrary Magic Constants** (Tasks 391, 448, 467, 476):\n   - Hidden solutions contain specific numeric constants or strings that are completely arbitrary\n   - Simulated user cannot reveal these because they're only encoded in hidden code\n   - Examples: emission rates (391), \"Metro Comix\"/\"Metro Man\" filter (448), ATM skimmer tuples (467), piecewise formula constants (476)\n\n2. **Simulated User Contradicts Hidden Implementation** (Tasks 396, 419, 460, 473):\n   - Simulated user provides guidance that contradicts what the hidden solution does\n   - Agent follows user guidance → fails evaluation\n   - Examples: return type mismatch (396), formula differences (419, 460), majority vs sum-all (473)\n\n3. **Task Description Mismatches Hidden Solution** (Tasks 482, 493):\n   - Task asks for one thing (phonetic similarity, SVG content analysis)\n   - Hidden solution does something completely different (character overlap, filename extension check)\n\n### Fix Strategy Applied:\nEach fix uses `instruction_override.json` to add clarifications that make the actual expected behavior discoverable, without:\n- Revealing complete solutions (agent must still implement the logic)\n- Making tasks easier (complexity preserved)\n- Giving hints about approach (only specifying requirements)\n\nThe fixes make evaluation **FAIR** by ensuring the expected behavior can be derived from the specification, while preserving the **collaborative coding challenge**.","session_id":"209c400b-8037-4752-93db-de52fdfbc31b","total_cost_usd":2.790605250000002,"usage":{"input_tokens":2,"cache_creation_input_tokens":67681,"cache_read_input_tokens":3756556,"output_tokens":18708,"server_tool_use":{"web_search_requests":0,"web_fetch_requests":0},"service_tier":"standard","cache_creation":{"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":67681}},"modelUsage":{"claude-opus-4-5-20251101":{"inputTokens":2,"outputTokens":18708,"cacheReadInputTokens":3756556,"cacheCreationInputTokens":67681,"webSearchRequests":0,"costUSD":2.7689942500000013,"contextWindow":200000,"maxOutputTokens":64000},"claude-haiku-4-5-20251001":{"inputTokens":16311,"outputTokens":1060,"cacheReadInputTokens":0,"cacheCreationInputTokens":0,"webSearchRequests":0,"costUSD":0.021611000000000002,"contextWindow":200000,"maxOutputTokens":64000}},"permission_denials":[],"uuid":"4e4938a5-80ef-4a0d-b503-10cb4a5a42d4"}
