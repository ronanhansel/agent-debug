    "For this simplified model, use a flat 15% tax rate on the excess salary (team_salary - luxury_tax_threshold).",
    "For repeat offenders, add an additional surcharge: for each complete $5,000,000 of excess salary, add $0.05 to the tax.",
    "Return 0 if team salary does not exceed the luxury tax threshold."

  "notes": "The hidden implementation uses a simplified formula (15% flat rate + repeat offender surcharge per 5M) that differs from actual NBA CBA brackets. Without specifying these constants, agents cannot derive the expected behavior."
