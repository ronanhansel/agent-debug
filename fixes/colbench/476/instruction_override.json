  "notes": "The problem description and simulated user both explicitly acknowledge not knowing the formula. The hidden solution contains specific piecewise constants (thresholds at 25/31, offsets 30/35/40, multipliers 50/40/30) that cannot be discovered through dialogue. This fix provides the formula."
