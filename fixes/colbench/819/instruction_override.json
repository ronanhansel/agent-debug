    "The baseline driving share is 89% (0.89) of total travelers.",
    "For the year 2012 specifically, ignore the economy_impact and return total_travelers * 0.89",
    "For all other years, calculate: total_travelers * (0.89 - economy_impact/100)",
    "The economy_impact is a percentage point reduction from the baseline (e.g., economy_impact=5 means reduce share by 5 percentage points).",

  "notes": "The original task does not specify the baseline percentage, the special-case year, or how economy_impact affects the calculation. The simulated user explicitly denied knowing these values despite them being in the hidden information. This fix makes the expected formula explicit."
