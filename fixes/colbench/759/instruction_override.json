    "4. The dna_sequence string either contains 'hand of man' as a substring OR starts with 'cDNA'",

  ],
  "notes": "The hidden implementation uses specific magic thresholds (>1000) and string checks ('hand of man', 'cDNA' prefix) that cannot be derived from the vague prompt. The 'hand of man' and 'cDNA' checks relate to patent law concepts but the prompt doesn't mention them. These arbitrary conditions make the task unsolvable without clarification."
