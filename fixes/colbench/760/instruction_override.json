    "The dot_size parameter is not used in this implementation - ignore it.",
    "The pattern is created using the rule: a dot (value 1) is placed at position (i, j) if (i + j) % gap == 0, otherwise value is 0.",
    "IMPORTANT OUTPUT FORMAT: Return a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a row. Each row dictionary has column indices (integers) as keys and 0 or 1 as values.",
    "Example for a 3x3 pattern with gap=2: [{0: 1, 1: 0, 2: 1}, {0: 0, 1: 1, 2: 0}, {0: 1, 1: 0, 2: 1}]"

  "notes": "The hidden implementation returns list of dicts (not a 2D list), uses (i+j) % gap for placement, and ignores dot_size. The simulated user reportedly gave contradictory guidance about using 2D lists and dot_size as block size. This fix corrects those contradictions."
