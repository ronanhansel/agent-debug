    "Despite the name 'sounds similar', use this positional character matching algorithm:",
    "1. Remove all spaces from both phrases and convert to lowercase",
    "2. Zip the two strings together (comparing characters at the same position)",
    "3. Count how many positions have matching characters",
    "4. Divide the match count by the length of the target phrase",
    "5. Return True if this ratio >= tolerance, else False",
    "Note: This is NOT phonetic comparison - it's positional character overlap."
  ],
  "notes": "The task description says 'sounds similar' which implies phonetic comparison, but the hidden solution implements positional character matching after removing spaces. This is a spec/implementation mismatch that cannot be resolved through dialogue. The fix clarifies the actual algorithm expected."
