Let me provide a summary:\n\n## Summary\n\nI analyzed and documented all 10 ColBench tasks. All were identified as having **Intrinsic Formation Errors (IFEs)** that **cannot be fixed at the task level without \"nerfing\"** (making the task easier by revealing the answer).\n\n### Common Patterns Found:\n\n1. **Arbitrary Magic Constants** (Tasks 62, 69, 146, 248): Hidden code contains specific numeric thresholds, keyword lists, or formulas that are arbitrary and not derivable from the task description or through dialogue.\n\n2. **Simulated User Limitations** (Tasks 62, 69, 144, 146, 166, 248): The simulated user is constrained to only answer from hidden information, but the hidden info is code rather than natural-language facts. This causes the user to respond \"I don't know\" to legitimate clarifying questions.\n\n3. **Simulated User Hallucination** (Tasks 250, 287): The simulated user invents requirements not present in the hidden code, actively misleading the agent.\n\n4. **Spec/Implementation Mismatch** (Tasks 144, 166, 185): The task description implies one behavior but the hidden code implements something different (containment vs overlap, advisory vs boolean, formula direction).\n\n5. **Semantic Errors in Ground Truth** (Task 180): The hidden code contains factually incorrect requirements (checking for SMTPS:// on an IMAP server).\n\n6. **Magic String Requirements** (Tasks 166, 287): Hidden code requires exact string matches (`'sturdy'`, `'family_friendly'`) that are unguessable.\n\n### Why No Code Fixes Were Applied:\n\nFor all tasks, applying instruction_override, evaluation_override, or simulated_user_override would either:\n- Reveal the answer (nerfing the task)\n- Not address the fundamental benchmark design issue\n- Conflict with the hidden test cases\n\nThese are **benchmark design flaws** where:\n- The hidden ground truth contains implementation details that should be communicated but aren't\n- The simulated user mechanism cannot reliably extract/convey these details from code-based hidden info\n- The evaluation tests against specific arbitrary values that can't be reasonably inferred","session_id":"3730ac47-c76f-4511-9993-343e5009651a","total_cost_usd":1.5889749999999996,"usage":{"input_tokens":2,"cache_creation_input_tokens":77744,"cache_read_input_tokens":1470334,"output_tokens":14217,"server_tool_use":{"web_search_requests":0,"web_fetch_requests":0},"service_tier":"standard","cache_creation":{"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":77744}},"modelUsage":{"claude-opus-4-5-20251101":{"inputTokens":2,"outputTokens":14217,"cacheReadInputTokens":1470334,"cacheCreationInputTokens":77744,"webSearchRequests":0,"costUSD":1.5765019999999998,"contextWindow":200000,"maxOutputTokens":64000},"claude-haiku-4-5-20251001":{"inputTokens":11373,"outputTokens":220,"cacheReadInputTokens":0,"cacheCreationInputTokens":0,"webSearchRequests":0,"costUSD":0.012473,"contextWindow":200000,"maxOutputTokens":64000}},"permission_denials":[],"uuid":"67f655ea-91dd-4fb2-bf4c-e3fc5395b4f9"}
