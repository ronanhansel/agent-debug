Here's the summary:\n\n## Summary of ColBench Frontend Tasks Analysis\n\n### Common Infrastructure IFE (affects all tasks)\n\nAll 8 frontend tasks share a common **infrastructure-level IFE**: the simulated user visual comparison loop is broken:\n\n1. **Parser Mismatch:** The smolagents execution environment expects Python-fenced code blocks (`````python```), but the task specification says to output raw HTML wrapped in `<html>` tags\n2. **Broken Visual Feedback:** The simulated user is supposed to compare the agent's rendered HTML to a ground truth image, but the rendering/passing mechanism fails, causing responses like \"The agent did not provide any visualization\"\n\n### Task-by-Task Summary\n\n| Task | IFE Type | Fix Created | Notes |\n|------|----------|-------------|-------|\n| **47** | Infrastructure only | README.md | Visual loop broken; task spec OK |\n| **48** | Infrastructure only | README.md | Visual loop broken; task spec OK |\n| **49** | Infrastructure + Task/GT mismatch | README.md + instruction_override.json | Task says \"property grid + sidebar\" but GT is minimal |\n| **62** | Infrastructure only | README.md | Visual loop broken; underspecified task vs exact-match eval |\n| **64** | Infrastructure only | README.md | Visual loop broken; task spec OK |\n| **66** | Infrastructure + Task/GT mismatch | README.md + instruction_override.json | Task says \"left sidebar with filters\" but GT has section-based layout |\n| **69** | Infrastructure only (mixed evidence) | README.md | Some evals show partial visual feedback working |\n| **77** | Infrastructure + Task/GT mismatch | README.md + instruction_override.json | Task says \"slideshow banner\" but GT has static pink header |\n\n### Fixes Applied\n\nFor tasks with **task specification vs ground truth mismatches** (49, 66, 77), I created `instruction_override.json` files with clarifications that:\n- Align the task description with what the ground truth actually shows\n- Preserve the collaborative design challenge (don't give away the answer)\n- Make evaluation fair without making it easy\n\nFor tasks with **infrastructure-only issues** (47, 48, 62, 64, 69), I documented the IFE but did not create code fixes because:\n- The issues are in the evaluation pipeline (visual rendering, parser), not the task specification\n- Creating workarounds would either \"nerf\" the task or not address the root cause","session_id":"1bbdf150-90df-45c3-bfd8-2c699609c1ed","total_cost_usd":2.3261302499999994,"usage":{"input_tokens":2,"cache_creation_input_tokens":89117,"cache_read_input_tokens":2869242,"output_tokens":11947,"server_tool_use":{"web_search_requests":0,"web_fetch_requests":0},"service_tier":"standard","cache_creation":{"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":89117}},"modelUsage":{"claude-opus-4-5-20251101":{"inputTokens":2,"outputTokens":11947,"cacheReadInputTokens":2869242,"cacheCreationInputTokens":89117,"webSearchRequests":0,"costUSD":2.29028725,"contextWindow":200000,"maxOutputTokens":64000},"claude-haiku-4-5-20251001":{"inputTokens":28743,"outputTokens":1420,"cacheReadInputTokens":0,"cacheCreationInputTokens":0,"webSearchRequests":0,"costUSD":0.035843,"contextWindow":200000,"maxOutputTokens":64000}},"permission_denials":[],"uuid":"60b0378f-8cdd-4fab-9170-8aaca53097cf"}
