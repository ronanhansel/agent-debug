    "CRITICAL: Your final Python code MUST include these import statements at the top: `import deepchem as dc`, `from deepchem.feat import MolGraphConvFeaturizer`, `from deepchem.models import GraphConvModel`, `from rdkit import Chem`, `from rdkit.Chem import Draw`. The evaluation environment has these packages pre-installed.",
    "The development sandbox blocks these imports, but the evaluation Docker container has TensorFlow 2.17, DeepChem, RDKit, and DGL properly configured. Write your code as if imports work.",
    "Use MolGraphConvFeaturizer with per_atom_fragmentation=True for atomic contribution analysis.",
    "For molecular visualization with atomic contributions, use rdkit.Chem.Draw.SimilarityMaps or highlight atoms based on model attribution scores.",
    "Load SDF files using: `molecules = Chem.SDMolSupplier('path/to/file.sdf')` or DeepChem's `dc.data.SDFLoader`.",
    "Save the final figure to 'pred_results/atomic_contrib_pred.png' using matplotlib's savefig()."
