  "root_cause": "Agent sandbox blocks deepchem/rdkit imports during development, causing pipreqs to not detect these packages, which means DGL is not installed in evaluation container",
  "fix_description": "instruction_override tells agent to include proper import statements; this triggers pipreqs detection and DGL post-install hook",
  "notes": "Docker base image has Python 3.10, TensorFlow 2.17, RDKit pre-installed. The issue was pipreqs detection, not package availability."
