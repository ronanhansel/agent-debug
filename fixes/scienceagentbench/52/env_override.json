  "notes": "Task requires DeepChem for graph convolutional network training. The base Docker image has TensorFlow 2.17, RDKit, and torch 2.3 pre-installed. The Dockerfile has special handling for deepchem (adds dgl) but only if pipreqs detects 'deepchem' in the agent's code. The instruction_override ensures agents write code with proper deepchem imports."
