  "clarifications": [
    "When creating a GeoDataFrame, always specify the geometry column explicitly in the constructor: gpd.GeoDataFrame(data, geometry='geometry_column_name') or use set_geometry() after construction.",
    "Required imports: geopandas (as gpd), geoplot (as gplt), geoplot.crs as gcrs",
    "Use geoplot.quadtree() with a GeoDataFrame that has an active geometry column set",
    "For spatial joins and analysis, ensure geometry columns are properly set before operations"
  ],
  "notes": "This clarification addresses GeoDataFrame API deprecation warnings that agents cannot discover due to sandbox restrictions blocking geopandas imports during development."
