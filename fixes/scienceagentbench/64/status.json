  "fix_description": "instruction_override tells agent to include proper import statements for oggm; this triggers pipreqs detection and automatic addition of salem, tables, geopandas",
  "notes": "Docker harness has special handling for OGGM but only if pipreqs detects 'oggm' in the agent's generated code. Extended timeout for network operations."
