You are diagnosing and fixing Intrinsic Formation Errors (IFEs) in ScienceAgentBench tasks.

**YOU HAVE 5 TASKS TO PROCESS: 56, 63, 64, 69, 73**

Process each task sequentially, creating fixes as needed. Be THOROUGH in your analysis.

## CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS - READ CAREFULLY

1. **FIX INTRINSIC FORMATION ERRORS ONLY** - Do NOT make the scientific problem easier
2. **PRESERVE SCIENTIFIC RIGOR** - The task should remain as challenging as intended
3. **NO NERFING** - Do not simplify scientific concepts, give hints, reduce precision, or pre-compute results
4. **VALID FIXES**: Environment packages, Docker config, evaluation tolerance, ambiguous instructions
5. **INVALID FIXES**: Solution hints, simplified science, pre-importing specialized modules

## SCIENCEAGENTBENCH HARNESS STRUCTURE

**First, read these files to understand the benchmark:**
- `hal-harness/hal/benchmarks/scienceagentbench.py` - Main benchmark class
- `hal-harness/hal/benchmarks/scienceagentbench/ScienceAgentBench/` - Evaluation harness

**How Evaluation Works:**
1. Agent produces Python code for a scientific task
2. Code is executed in Docker container with `evaluation/harness.py`
3. Metrics collected: Valid Execution Rate, Success Rate (task-specific criteria), CodeBERTScore
4. For visualization tasks: GPT-4 compares generated figures to gold standard

**To inspect a specific task, run:**
```python
from datasets import load_dataset
ds = load_dataset("osunlp/ScienceAgentBench", split="validation")
task = ds[int(TASK_ID) - 1]  # 1-indexed
print(task['task_inst'])  # Task instruction
print(task['dataset_folder_tree'])  # Data files available
```

## THOROUGH ERROR ANALYSIS CHECKLIST

For EACH task, systematically check ALL of these potential error sources:

### 1. Environment/Dependency Issues
- [ ] Missing Python packages in Docker container (oggm, mne, mastml, biopsykit)
- [ ] Package version conflicts between scientific libraries
- [ ] Missing system libraries (GDAL, MPI, etc.)
- [ ] Conda vs pip installation conflicts for scientific packages
- [ ] GPU/CUDA requirements for deep learning tasks
- [ ] Memory/timeout limits too restrictive for large datasets

### 2. Data/Input Issues
- [ ] Missing or corrupted data files in dataset
- [ ] Data format differs from task documentation
- [ ] Column names don't match task description
- [ ] Encoding issues with scientific data files
- [ ] File path mismatches between task description and actual paths

### 3. Task Specification Issues
- [ ] Ambiguous output format requirements
- [ ] Unclear success criteria (what makes output "correct"?)
- [ ] Missing domain knowledge in instructions (formulas, methods)
- [ ] Conflicting requirements between task steps
- [ ] Unstated assumptions from source scientific papers

### 4. Evaluation Script Issues
- [ ] Numerical tolerance too strict for scientific precision
- [ ] Format-sensitive comparison (whitespace, column ordering)
- [ ] Evaluation crashes on valid but alternative outputs
- [ ] Metrics don't match task description expectations
- [ ] GPT-4 judge subjectivity for figure/visualization tasks

### 5. Gold Program/Reference Issues
- [ ] Gold program has hardcoded paths
- [ ] Gold program uses unavailable or outdated libraries
- [ ] Multiple scientifically valid approaches rejected
- [ ] Gold program doesn't match task requirements exactly

### 6. Cross-Model Failure Patterns
- [ ] Same error across ALL models → likely IFE
- [ ] Valid output rejected by evaluation → evaluation issue
- [ ] Environment blocks ALL models identically → setup issue
- [ ] Figure evaluation fails for functionally equivalent plots

## KNOWN IFE PATTERNS (from trace analysis)

**Environment Issues (High Priority):**
- Task 74: `oggm` / `oggm.core.distribute_2d` (glacier modeling) not available
- Task 43: `mne` (neuroimaging) not available
- Task 2: `mastml.features` (materials science ML) not available
- Other domain-specific packages: `biopsykit`, specialized GIS libraries

**Figure Evaluation Issues:**
- GPT-4 judge penalizes functionally equivalent but stylistically different visualizations
- Color scheme differences cause failures despite correct scientific content
- Axis label formatting differences cause failures
- Tasks 8, 25, 28, 50, 59, 68, 84, 91, 93 have figure evaluation issues

**Key Statistics:**
- 67/102 tasks failed across ALL 4 models (GPT-4.1, O3, O4-mini-high, O4-mini-low)
- 39 tasks have runtime errors in 2+ models
- 13 tasks have figure comparison failures in 2+ models

## FIX OUTPUT FORMAT

For each task that needs a fix, create: `fixes/scienceagentbench/TASK_ID/`

**Environment Fixes** (`env_override.json`):
```json
{
  "HAL_CONDA_CHANNELS": "conda-forge",
  "HAL_CONDA_PACKAGES": "mne oggm",
  "HAL_PIP_PACKAGES": "biopsykit mastml",
  "HAL_APT_PACKAGES": "libfoo-dev",
  "HAL_TIMEOUT_SECONDS": 600,
  "notes": "Justification for these environment changes"
}
```

**Evaluation Fixes** (`evaluation_override.json`):
```json
{
  "figure_tolerance": "relaxed",
  "numerical_tolerance": 1e-4,
  "accept_alternative_formats": true,
  "skip_style_check": true,
  "notes": "Why this adjustment is fair, not a nerf"
}
```

**Instruction Clarifications** (`instruction_override.json`):
```json
{
  "clarifications": [
    "Output file must be named exactly 'output.csv'",
    "Use specific library version X"
  ],
  "additional_context": "Any missing domain knowledge needed"
}
```

**Documentation** (`README.md`):
- Root cause analysis of the IFE
- What fix was applied and why
- Why this preserves task difficulty
- Expected outcome after fix

If NO fix needed (capability issue, not IFE), create README.md explaining why.

## FIX RUNNER SCRIPT

After creating fixes, also check/update the fix runner script:
`scripts/run_scienceagentbench_fixes.py`

The fix runner must:
1. Load fixes from `fixes/scienceagentbench/<task_id>/`
2. Apply environment overrides before Docker evaluation
3. Inject instruction clarifications into task prompts
4. Adjust evaluation parameters as specified
5. Run HAL evaluation with fixes applied
6. Output new traces with configurable prefix

**Reference implementation**: See `scripts/run_scicode_fixes.py` for the pattern.

### Rubric Evaluations

### Evaluation 1 (from scienceagentbench_hal_generalist_agent_o320250416_1746110877_UPLOAD)
- **Grade**: 1.00 (1.0 = IFE detected, 0.0 = no IFE)
- **Explanation**: existence_reasoning: The task instructions explicitly require using the Iris ecosystem (iris.load, iris.plot, cube.collapsed) and producing a plot image, but the execution environment shown in the transcript blocks imports required to complete the task: `iris` is disallowed, `matplotlib.pyplot` is disallowed, and even `scipy.io.netcdf` (a reasonable fallback to read NetCDF) is disallowed. This indicates an intrinsic environment/package-availability mismatch: the benchmark expects NetCDF reading + plotting capabilities that are not available under the provided allowed-import constraints. | causation_reasoning: The agent's attempted solutions failed specifically because required libraries were blocked by the environment, not due to scientific or coding mistakes. Without any permitted NetCDF reader (iris/netCDF4/scipy.io.netcdf) and without matplotlib, no agent could both load the provided `.nc` dataset and generate the required plot file as specified. Thus the benchmark/environment defect directly prevented success. | evidence: Runtime error messages: "Import of iris is not allowed. Authorized imports are: [...]" and "Code execution failed at line 'import matplotlib.pyplot as plt' due to: InterpreterError: Import of matplotlib.pyplot is not allowed." and "Code execution failed at line 'from scipy.io import netcdf' due to: InterpreterError: Import from scipy.io is not allowed." Task requirement: "iris.plot is a Iris-specific package... The iris.load() function..." and dataset provided only as NetCDF: "E1_north_america.nc".


### Evaluation 2 (from scienceagentbench_hal_generalist_agent_o4mini20250416_low_1746044336_UPLOAD)
- **Grade**: 1.00 (1.0 = IFE detected, 0.0 = no IFE)
- **Explanation**: existence_reasoning: The task instructions explicitly require using the Iris library ("iris.load()", "iris.plot", Constraints, cube.collapsed) and Matplotlib, but the provided execution tool environment used during the run forbids importing `iris` (and also `matplotlib.pyplot`). This is an execution environment/package availability restriction that prevents any Iris-based solution from running in this environment, independent of agent quality. | causation_reasoning: All attempts that tried to follow the task (load NetCDF via Iris and plot) failed immediately at import time with an interpreter restriction. Because the benchmark setup/tooling disallows `import iris`, no agent could execute a compliant Iris solution in this run environment; thus the benchmark/environment defect directly caused the failure. | evidence: Multiple tool failures show environment import restrictions: "Code execution failed at line 'import iris' due to: InterpreterError: Import of iris is not allowed." Also: "Code execution failed at line 'import matplotlib.pyplot as plt' due to: InterpreterError: Import of matplotlib.pyplot is not allowed." The task itself requires Iris usage: "iris.plot is a Iris-specific package extensions... The iris.load() function... cube.collapsed()..."


### Evaluation 3 (from scienceagentbench_hal_generalist_agent_gpt4120250414_1745541259_UPLOAD)
- **Grade**: 1.00 (1.0 = IFE detected, 0.0 = no IFE)
- **Explanation**: existence_reasoning: The task explicitly requires the Iris library (and implicitly matplotlib via iris.plot) to load a NetCDF file and create a plot. However, the provided execution environment forbids importing `iris` and `matplotlib.pyplot`, and also provides no alternative permitted NetCDF reader. Additionally, the provided file-inspection tool cannot read `.nc` files. This is an intrinsic environment/tooling mismatch: the benchmark task depends on packages/tools that are unavailable in the sandbox. | causation_reasoning: The agent’s attempts fail immediately due to environment import restrictions (`iris`, `matplotlib.pyplot`) and inability to inspect/read the NetCDF file. Because the benchmark environment blocks the required dependencies and file access pathways, no agent can successfully execute a compliant solution (load NetCDF + plot) within this environment. Thus the benchmark defect directly caused the failure. | evidence: Execution errors show missing/forbidden dependencies and unreadable dataset format: "Import of iris is not allowed. Authorized imports are: [...]"; "Import of matplotlib.pyplot is not allowed."; and dataset inspection failure: "FileConversionException: Could not convert '...E1_north_america.nc' to Markdown... UnicodeDecodeError".


### Evaluation 4 (from scienceagentbench_hal_generalist_agent_o4mini20250416_high_1746044352_UPLOAD)
- **Grade**: 1.00 (1.0 = IFE detected, 0.0 = no IFE)
- **Explanation**: existence_reasoning: The run environment used for execution explicitly disallows importing the required domain library (Iris). The task instructions require using Iris APIs (iris.load, iris.plot, cube.collapsed), but the interpreter sandbox rejects `import iris` with an allowlist that does not include Iris. This is an intrinsic environment/setup mismatch: the benchmark task depends on Iris, yet the provided execution environment for the run cannot import it. | causation_reasoning: The agent's solution approach is reasonable and directly aligned with the task. However, every execution attempt fails immediately at `import iris` before any dataset loading or computation can occur. Because the required library cannot be imported in this environment, no compliant Iris-based solution can execute successfully here, so the environment defect directly caused the failure. | evidence: Repeated execution errors: "Code execution failed at line 'import iris' due to: InterpreterError: Import of iris is not allowed. Authorized imports are: [...]" (e.g., call_2/call_3/call_4/call_7/call_9/call_10/call_12/call_15/call_17/call_18/call_19). Task requirement explicitly references Iris: "iris.plot is a Iris-specific package... The iris.load() function... cube.collapsed()..."


### Judge Verdict

**Final Grade**: 1.0
**Satisfies Rubric (has IFE)**: True
**Judge Reasoning**: Claimed issue: The task instructions require using the Iris ecosystem (iris.load / cube.collapsed / iris.plot) and producing a plot from a provided NetCDF (.nc) file, but the execution sandbox disallows importing `iris` and `matplotlib.pyplot` (and even suggested fallbacks like `scipy.io.netcdf`), and the file-inspection tool cannot read the .nc file.

Why I accept it (despite skepticism): Multiple independent runs report concrete, specific interpreter allowlist errors at `import iris` (and `import matplotlib.pyplot`)—this is not a subtle runtime bug or agent logic error. If the benchmark explicitly mandates Iris usage, then banning `iris` in the only execution pathway is a direct contradiction between requirements and environment. Similarly, requiring a plot while forbidding matplotlib (and apparently not providing an alternative plotting backend) makes compliance infeasible. The inability to even inspect/read the .nc through provided tools further removes workaround paths.

Alternative explanations considered: (1) The task might not *actually* require Iris/matplotlib and could allow other libraries—rejected because the evaluations quote the task as explicitly requiring Iris APIs and iris.plot. (2) A stronger agent could bypass by using a permitted NetCDF reader/plotter—rejected because the evidence indicates the common NetCDF readers are blocked and matplotlib is blocked; without any permitted NetCDF IO plus plotting, there is no viable workaround. (3) The agent could output a plot without reading the file—would not satisfy the task of plotting data from the provided dataset.

Final determination: Overwhelming evidence of an environment/package-availability mismatch that prevents any compliant solution; this is an intrinsic benchmark/setup defect (IFE).

### Rubric Evaluations

### Evaluation 1 (from scienceagentbench_hal_generalist_agent_o320250416_1746110877_UPLOAD)
- **Grade**: 1.00 (1.0 = IFE detected, 0.0 = no IFE)
- **Explanation**: existence_reasoning: The task instructions explicitly require using NeuroKit2 functions (ecg_process/rsp_process and ecg_plot/rsp_plot). However, the execution environment restricts imports to a fixed allowlist that excludes both neurokit2 and matplotlib.pyplot. This creates an intrinsic incompatibility between the benchmark task requirements and the provided execution environment/library allowlist. | causation_reasoning: Because neurokit2 cannot be imported in the environment, no compliant solution (i.e., one that uses NeuroKit2 as required) can run successfully. Similarly, matplotlib.pyplot is disallowed, blocking the expected plotting path. The agent's initial attempts failed specifically due to these environment import restrictions, not due to scientific or coding mistakes. The agent ultimately produced a non-NeuroKit2 workaround, but that violates the task's explicit requirement; thus, the benchmark setup prevents a fully compliant solution from succeeding. | evidence: Environment rejection of required libs:
- "InterpreterError: Import of matplotlib.pyplot is not allowed. Authorized imports are: [...]"
- "InterpreterError: Import of neurokit2 is not allowed. Authorized imports are: [...]"
Task requirement forcing those libs:
- "NeuroKit2 is a user-friendly package... Use ecg_process() and rsp_process()... then use ecg_plot() and rsp_plot()"


### Evaluation 2 (from scienceagentbench_hal_generalist_agent_o4mini20250416_low_1746044336_UPLOAD)
- **Grade**: 1.00 (1.0 = IFE detected, 0.0 = no IFE)
- **Explanation**: existence_reasoning: The benchmark task explicitly requires NeuroKit2 (ecg_process/rsp_process and ecg_plot/rsp_plot). However, the provided execution environment used for the run disallows importing neurokit2 (and also disallows common plotting/scientific modules like matplotlib.pyplot and scipy.signal access patterns). This is an execution-environment/package-availability mismatch: the task is formulated around NeuroKit2 but the environment prevents using it, making the specified solution path impossible. | causation_reasoning: The run failures are directly caused by the environment forbidding the required imports/modules. The agent attempted to follow instructions (import neurokit2; use plotting) but was blocked repeatedly by InterpreterError. Because the task mandates NeuroKit2 usage, and NeuroKit2 cannot be imported in this environment, no agent could successfully complete the task as specified under these constraints. | evidence: Task requirement: "Use ecg_process() and rsp_process() ... then use ecg_plot() and rsp_plot()". Environment errors: "Code execution failed at line 'import neurokit2 as nk' due to: InterpreterError: Import of neurokit2 is not allowed." Also: "import matplotlib.pyplot as plt ... InterpreterError: Import of matplotlib.pyplot is not allowed." And SciPy signal access: "Forbidden access to module: scipy.signal".


### Evaluation 3 (from scienceagentbench_hal_generalist_agent_gpt4120250414_1745541259_UPLOAD)
- **Grade**: 1.00 (1.0 = IFE detected, 0.0 = no IFE)
- **Explanation**: existence_reasoning: The task instructions explicitly require NeuroKit2 (ecg_process/rsp_process/ecg_plot/rsp_plot) and saving PNG visualizations with tight bounding boxes. However, the execution environment blocks importing neurokit2 and matplotlib, and also blocks PIL.Image access and scipy.signal, eliminating standard ways to process signals per instructions and to generate/save the required PNG plots. This is an intrinsic environment mismatch: the benchmark demands specific libraries/capabilities that the sandbox disallows. | causation_reasoning: The agent's failures stem directly from forbidden imports of the required tooling. Because neurokit2 and plotting/image libraries are disallowed, no agent can satisfy the instruction to use NeuroKit2 and produce the required PNG outputs in this environment. The agent could compute metrics via numpy, but the benchmark-required artifacts (bio_ecg_plot.png, bio_rsp_plot.png produced via ecg_plot/rsp_plot) are impossible given the restrictions; thus the benchmark defect causes the failure. | evidence: 1) "Code execution failed at line 'import neurokit2 as nk' due to: InterpreterError: Import of neurokit2 is not allowed." 2) "Code execution failed at line 'import matplotlib.pyplot as plt' due to: InterpreterError: Import of matplotlib.pyplot is not allowed." 3) "Code execution failed at line 'from scipy.signal import find_peaks, butter, filtfilt' due to: InterpreterError: Import from scipy.signal is not allowed." 4) "Forbidden access to module: PIL.Image" when attempting to save PNGs. 5) Task requirement: "Use ecg_process() and rsp_process()... then use ecg_plot() and rsp_plot()... Save the visualization... into 'pred_results/bio_ecg_plot.png' and 'pred_results/bio_rsp_plot.png'."


### Evaluation 4 (from scienceagentbench_hal_generalist_agent_o4mini20250416_high_1746044352_UPLOAD)
- **Grade**: 1.00 (1.0 = IFE detected, 0.0 = no IFE)
- **Explanation**: existence_reasoning: The benchmark task explicitly requires using NeuroKit2 (ecg_process/rsp_process and ecg_plot/rsp_plot) and saving plots. However, the execution environment blocks importing required libraries (neurokit2, matplotlib.pyplot, scipy.signal, and even PIL.Image in later attempts). Additionally, path utilities like os.path.join trigger forbidden access to posixpath. These restrictions constitute an execution environment defect relative to task requirements, since the mandated approach cannot run. | causation_reasoning: The agent’s failures stem directly from environment import/module restrictions rather than scientific/implementation mistakes. When attempting the required NeuroKit2 solution, execution immediately fails due to banned imports. Attempts to switch to reasonable alternatives (scipy.signal for filtering/peaks, matplotlib for plotting, PIL for image output) also fail due to the same type of restrictions, preventing generation of the required outputs (especially the plot PNGs). Thus, no agent could succeed under these constraints while following task requirements. | evidence: Required library blocked: "Code execution failed at line 'import neurokit2 as nk' due to: InterpreterError: Import of neurokit2 is not allowed." Plotting blocked: "import matplotlib.pyplot as plt' ... Import of matplotlib.pyplot is not allowed." Signal processing blocked: "Forbidden access to module: scipy.signal" (both "from scipy import signal" and "sp.signal.butter"). Image output blocked: "Forbidden access to module: PIL.Image". Path handling blocked: "os.path.join(...) ... Forbidden access to module: posixpath".


### Judge Verdict

**Final Grade**: 1.0
**Satisfies Rubric (has IFE)**: True
**Judge Reasoning**: (1) Claimed issue: The task explicitly requires using NeuroKit2 functions (ecg_process/rsp_process and ecg_plot/rsp_plot) and saving PNG plots. Multiple independent runs report that importing neurokit2 is forbidden by the execution sandbox, and also that common required plotting/signal/image libraries (matplotlib.pyplot, scipy.signal, PIL.Image) are blocked.

(2) Why I accept it despite skepticism: This is not a vague complaint about difficulty or correctness—each evaluation cites concrete InterpreterError/forbidden-module messages at the exact imports that the instructions mandate. If neurokit2 is unimportable, then a solution that follows the task’s explicit “Use ecg_process/rsp_process… then ecg_plot/rsp_plot” requirement cannot even execute. That is a direct incompatibility between task specification and environment.

(3) Alternative explanations considered: 
- Agent mistake (wrong import name, typo, etc.): Unlikely because the error is “import ... is not allowed” with an allowlist, not “module not found,” and it occurs across multiple agents.
- Workaround without NeuroKit2: Even if possible with numpy-only signal processing, it would violate the task’s explicit requirement to use NeuroKit2 and its plotting functions; additionally, plotting/image-output libraries are reportedly blocked too, making the required PNG artifacts infeasible.
- Misreporting by evaluators: Four separate runs report the same class of allowlist restriction errors for the same libraries; that consistency is strong evidence.

(4) Final determination: Overwhelming evidence of an intrinsic environment/spec mismatch: the benchmark requires specific libraries/capabilities that the sandbox forbids, so a fully compliant solution is impossible. This meets the rubric for an IFE.

### Rubric Evaluations

### Evaluation 1 (from scienceagentbench_hal_generalist_agent_o320250416_1746110877_UPLOAD)
- **Grade**: 0.00 (1.0 = IFE detected, 0.0 = no IFE)
- **Explanation**: existence_reasoning: The run transcript shows the execution sandbox restricts imports to a whitelist that excludes key libraries required by the task as written (OGGM, matplotlib, tarfile). This is an execution environment deficiency relative to the task requirements (it explicitly requires OGGM and plotting). | causation_reasoning: Despite the environment restrictions, the run is marked as not failed ("failed": false). Therefore, the identified environment deficiency did not cause a benchmark failure in this specific run. Under the rubric, Score 1 requires that the defect both exists and caused the failure; here there is no failure attributable to the defect. | evidence: Errors showing restricted environment imports: "Import of tarfile is not allowed"; "Import of matplotlib.pyplot is not allowed"; "Import of oggm.cfg is not allowed". Yet run metadata states: "\"failed\": false".


### Evaluation 2 (from scienceagentbench_hal_generalist_agent_o4mini20250416_low_1746044336_UPLOAD)
- **Grade**: 1.00 (1.0 = IFE detected, 0.0 = no IFE)
- **Explanation**: existence_reasoning: The benchmark task requires using OGGM, matplotlib, and extracting a .tar.gz archive (tarfile or equivalent). However, the provided execution environment for the run (python_interpreter sandbox) disallows importing both tarfile and matplotlib.pyplot, and also disallows importing oggm entirely. This is an execution environment/tooling restriction that makes the stated task requirements impossible to satisfy within the benchmark’s run environment. | causation_reasoning: The run repeatedly failed at import time due to environment restrictions, before any scientific logic could execute. Since the task explicitly requires OGGM and generating/saving a plot, and the environment blocks oggm and matplotlib imports, no agent could complete the task as specified in this environment. Thus the benchmark/environment defect directly caused the failure. | evidence: Errors show banned imports needed for the task: "Code execution failed at line 'import tarfile' due to: InterpreterError: Import of tarfile is not allowed." Also plotting is blocked: "Code execution failed at line 'import matplotlib.pyplot as plt' due to: InterpreterError: Import of matplotlib.pyplot is not allowed." And OGGM itself is unavailable: "Code execution failed at line 'import oggm' due to: InterpreterError: Import of oggm is not allowed."


### Evaluation 3 (from scienceagentbench_hal_generalist_agent_gpt4120250414_1745541259_UPLOAD)
- **Grade**: 1.00 (1.0 = IFE detected, 0.0 = no IFE)
- **Explanation**: existence_reasoning: The task explicitly requires using OGGM (oggm.core.massbalance.MultipleFlowlineMassBalance) and producing/saving a plot. In the provided execution environment, imports required to complete the task are blocked: `oggm` cannot be imported, and `matplotlib.pyplot` cannot be imported. Additionally, `tarfile` is blocked, preventing straightforward extraction of the provided `.tar.gz` dataset within Python. With these restrictions, a correct solution that uses OGGM and generates the requested PNG cannot be executed in this environment. | causation_reasoning: The agent's attempts failed specifically due to environment import restrictions (not due to scientific reasoning or coding mistakes). Since OGGM and matplotlib are necessary to compute the MultipleFlowlineMassBalance and create the plot, no agent could successfully execute the intended workflow under these constraints. The agent could list archive contents via bash, but could not read the NetCDF diagnostics (binary) with the provided text-inspection tool, further preventing an OGGM-free workaround from the dataset alone. Therefore the benchmark/environment defect directly caused the failure. | evidence: Import restriction on OGGM: "InterpreterError: Import of oggm is not allowed. Authorized imports are: [...]".
Import restriction on plotting: "InterpreterError: Import of matplotlib.pyplot is not allowed. Authorized imports are: [...]".
Import restriction on extraction: "InterpreterError: Import of tarfile is not allowed. Authorized imports are: [...]".
NetCDF unreadable via provided tool: "FileConversionException: Could not convert '/tmp/RGI60-11.00001/fl_diagnostics_historical.nc' to Markdown... UnicodeDecodeError".
Dataset contents show required info likely in NetCDF/PKL, not accessible without OGGM/netCDF tooling: archive listing includes "fl_diagnostics_historical.nc" and "model_flowlines.pkl" (in tar), while extracted dir only had "/tmp/RGI60-11.00001/elevation_band_flowline.csv" and "/tmp/RG


### Evaluation 4 (from scienceagentbench_hal_generalist_agent_o4mini20250416_high_1746044352_UPLOAD)
- **Grade**: 1.00 (1.0 = IFE detected, 0.0 = no IFE)
- **Explanation**: existence_reasoning: The task explicitly requires using OGGM and producing a plot (commonly via matplotlib). However, the provided execution environment used for running the agent code blocks imports of both `matplotlib.pyplot` and `oggm` (not in the allowlist). This makes it impossible to execute any valid OGGM-based solution or generate the required plot in this environment, independent of agent capability. | causation_reasoning: The agent repeatedly attempted correct-looking OGGM+matplotlib solutions, but execution failed immediately at import time due to environment restrictions. Since the benchmark requires OGGM and a plot file output, and both OGGM and matplotlib are blocked, no agent could complete the task under these constraints. Therefore the environment deficiency directly caused the failure. | evidence: Multiple runs fail on import restrictions: (1) "Code execution failed at line 'import matplotlib.pyplot as plt' due to: InterpreterError: Import of matplotlib.pyplot is not allowed." (call_3/call_4/call_5/call_7/call_9/call_10/call_12/call_13/call_14/call_15/call_17). (2) When trying to avoid matplotlib, OGGM itself is blocked: "Code execution failed at line 'from oggm import cfg, workflow, tasks' due to: InterpreterError: Import from oggm is not allowed." (call_8). The allowlist shown does not include matplotlib or oggm.


### Judge Verdict

**Final Grade**: 1.0
**Satisfies Rubric (has IFE)**: True
**Judge Reasoning**: Claimed issue: The task instructions require using OGGM (e.g., oggm.core.massbalance.MultipleFlowlineMassBalance) and producing/saving a plot (typically via matplotlib), and the data is packaged as a .tar.gz that commonly needs tar extraction tooling.

Why I accept it: Multiple independent runs report hard sandbox import allowlist blocks for exactly the required libraries: `oggm` and `matplotlib.pyplot` are explicitly rejected at import time with InterpreterError messages. One run also reports `tarfile` blocked. These are not agent logic errors; they prevent any compliant implementation from even starting. If OGGM cannot be imported, the task’s explicit requirement to use OGGM cannot be met in this environment.

Alternative explanations considered: (a) Could the agent work around by not using OGGM or not plotting? Not if the task explicitly requires OGGM and a saved plot. (b) Could the agent use a different plotting library? Possibly, but the evaluations specifically indicate matplotlib is blocked and (more importantly) OGGM itself is blocked, which is the core requirement. (c) Is this just one flaky run? No—3/4 evaluations report the same fundamental import prohibition for OGGM/matplotlib.

About Evaluation 2 (grade 0): It argues the run was marked "failed": false, so the defect didn’t cause failure in that run. That doesn’t negate an IFE: the question here is whether the task/environment is intrinsically unsatisfiable as specified. Blocking OGGM in the execution environment while requiring OGGM is a direct, irrefutable formation error regardless of a particular run’s metadata flag.

Final determination: Overwhelming evidence of an environment/benchmark defect (required dependencies are forbidden), making the task impossible to complete as written. Grade 1.

### Rubric Evaluations

### Evaluation 1 (from scienceagentbench_hal_generalist_agent_o320250416_1746110877_UPLOAD)
- **Grade**: 1.00 (1.0 = IFE detected, 0.0 = no IFE)
- **Explanation**: existence_reasoning: The task implicitly requires AnnData/Scanpy (or equivalent) to read a .h5ad file and run a standard single-cell pipeline (filter genes, PCA, UMAP, plotting). However, the execution environment explicitly disallows importing scanpy, and the allowlist of imports shown does not include scanpy or anndata. This is an environment/library-availability defect relative to the task requirements. | causation_reasoning: The run failed because the environment prevented importing scanpy, which the agent used to read the AnnData file and compute PCA/UMAP/plot. Given the stated allowed imports, the agent cannot directly use scanpy/anndata to load .h5ad, so completing the task as specified is blocked by the environment restriction rather than agent reasoning/coding errors. | evidence: Repeated runtime error: "Code execution failed at line 'import scanpy as sc' due to: InterpreterError: Import of scanpy is not allowed. Authorized imports are: [...]" (call_2, call_3, call_4, call_5). Task requires AnnData/UMAP pipeline on `benchmark/datasets/hca/hca_subsampled_20k.h5ad`.


### Evaluation 2 (from scienceagentbench_hal_generalist_agent_o4mini20250416_low_1746044336_UPLOAD)
- **Grade**: 1.00 (1.0 = IFE detected, 0.0 = no IFE)
- **Explanation**: existence_reasoning: The task intrinsically expects use of AnnData/Scanpy workflow to read a .h5ad file and run standard single-cell preprocessing + PCA + UMAP. However, the provided execution environment explicitly forbids importing scanpy (and by implication prevents the canonical AnnData pipeline). This is an environment/setup defect relative to the benchmark task requirements. | causation_reasoning: The run repeatedly fails at the first required step (importing scanpy) with an InterpreterError, preventing any progress toward loading the dataset or producing the required plot. Given the environment restriction, no agent can succeed using the instructed/standard approach within this tool runtime; thus the benchmark/environment defect directly causes failure. | evidence: Repeated error: "Code execution failed at line 'import scanpy as sc' due to: InterpreterError: Import of scanpy is not allowed. Authorized imports are: [...]" (call_2, call_3, call_4, call_7, call_8, call_9, call_10, call_12, call_13, call_14, call_15). Task requirement implies scanpy/anndata usage: "The dataset is stored in the AnnData format" and solution attempts begin with "import scanpy as sc".


### Evaluation 3 (from scienceagentbench_hal_generalist_agent_gpt4120250414_1745541259_UPLOAD)
- **Grade**: 1.00 (1.0 = IFE detected, 0.0 = no IFE)
- **Explanation**: existence_reasoning: The task requires reading an AnnData .h5ad file and performing standard single-cell analysis steps (gene filtering, PCA, neighbors/UMAP, plotting). This intrinsically requires AnnData/HDF5-capable libraries such as scanpy/anndata and/or h5py. The execution environment explicitly disallows importing scanpy and h5py, and the provided file-inspection tool cannot read .h5ad. Thus the benchmark/environment setup is deficient for this task: required domain libraries and/or file support are unavailable. | causation_reasoning: The agent's failure is directly caused by the environment restrictions preventing any access to the dataset. Without the ability to read the .h5ad file (no scanpy/anndata/h5py; no tool support for .h5ad), no agent can complete the required computations and generate the requested plot within this environment. The repeated crashes occur at import time, before any task logic can run, demonstrating impossibility rather than an agent implementation mistake. | evidence: Interpreter error on required library: "Code execution failed at line 'import scanpy as sc' due to: InterpreterError: Import of scanpy is not allowed." Also: "Code execution failed at line 'import h5py' due to: InterpreterError: Import of h5py is not allowed." And tool limitation: "UnsupportedFormatException: Could not convert 'benchmark/datasets/hca/hca_subsampled_20k.h5ad' to Markdown. The formats ['.h5ad'] are not supported."


### Evaluation 4 (from scienceagentbench_hal_generalist_agent_o4mini20250416_high_1746044352_UPLOAD)
- **Grade**: 1.00 (1.0 = IFE detected, 0.0 = no IFE)
- **Explanation**: existence_reasoning: A benchmark/environment defect exists: the execution sandbox used for this task explicitly forbids importing the standard library needed to solve the task (scanpy/anndata ecosystem). The task requires reading an .h5ad AnnData file and performing standard single-cell preprocessing + PCA + UMAP + plotting. In the provided environment, importing scanpy is disallowed by policy, preventing any scanpy-based solution from running. The allowlist also omits key alternatives such as anndata, h5py, umap-learn, and matplotlib (matplotlib is not on the allowlist shown), making it infeasible to implement the required pipeline within the restricted interpreter. | causation_reasoning: The agent's attempts failed at the first import step due to the environment restriction (InterpreterError) and therefore could not proceed to data loading, PCA/UMAP, or plotting. This is not an agent capability issue; even a correct solution cannot execute under these import constraints. The failure is directly caused by the environment's import allowlist conflicting with the task's required tooling. | evidence: Repeated runtime failure: "Code execution failed at line 'import scanpy as sc' due to: InterpreterError: Import of scanpy is not allowed. Authorized imports are: [...]" (e.g., call_2/call_3/call_4/.../call_19). Task requires AnnData processing/UMAP: "dataset is stored in the AnnData format" and "plot UMAP results using the top 30 PCA components" and "Save the UMAP visualization".


### Judge Verdict

**Final Grade**: 1.0
**Satisfies Rubric (has IFE)**: True
**Judge Reasoning**: Claimed issue: The task requires loading and processing an AnnData .h5ad file (single-cell pipeline incl. PCA, neighbors, UMAP, and plotting), but the execution environment forbids importing the key libraries needed to read .h5ad (scanpy, h5py; and likely anndata/umap/matplotlib per allowlist), and even the file-inspection tool cannot open .h5ad.

Why I accept it (despite skepticism): The evidence is concrete and repeated across independent runs: (a) the interpreter explicitly blocks `import scanpy` with an allowlist error; (b) `import h5py` is also blocked in at least one run; (c) the platform tool reports `.h5ad` as an unsupported format for inspection. Given that .h5ad is an HDF5-backed format, some HDF5/AnnData-capable library is intrinsically required to access the data. If both the canonical route (scanpy/anndata) and the low-level route (h5py) are disallowed, the dataset cannot be read at all, making downstream PCA/UMAP/plotting impossible.

Alternative explanations considered: A strong agent might avoid scanpy and implement PCA/UMAP with scikit-learn/etc.—but that still requires reading the .h5ad, which is the hard blocker. Another workaround would be converting the file via an external tool, but the sandbox appears to provide no such capability and explicitly cannot even render/convert .h5ad. Unless there exists some permitted library that can read .h5ad (not evidenced here) the task is unsatisfiable in this environment.

Final determination: This is overwhelming evidence of an environment/benchmark setup defect (missing/forbidden dependencies or file support) that prevents any agent from accessing the provided dataset, i.e., a true Intrinsic Formation Error.

### Rubric Evaluations

### Evaluation 1 (from scienceagentbench_hal_generalist_agent_o320250416_1746110877_UPLOAD)
- **Grade**: 0.00 (1.0 = IFE detected, 0.0 = no IFE)
- **Explanation**: existence_reasoning: The run shows strong evidence of execution environment restrictions that block common plotting approaches. Importing matplotlib is explicitly disallowed, and later PIL is also blocked. Additionally, an unusual sandbox restriction flags access to 'posixpath' (typically used implicitly by os.path). These indicate an environment/tooling constraint inconsistent with the task requirement to generate and save a plot image. | causation_reasoning: Despite the environment issues, the run is marked as not failed ("failed": false). Therefore, the benchmark defect did not cause a recorded failure for this run. The agent's final answer even reintroduced the disallowed matplotlib import, which would likely fail if executed, suggesting the success flag is independent of actual execution here. Under the rubric, since there is no actual task failure attributed to the defect in this transcript, it should not be scored as an IFE-caused failure. | evidence: Environment blocks plotting libs: "Import of matplotlib.pyplot is not allowed." and "Forbidden access to module: PIL.Image". Also: "Forbidden access to module: posixpath". Run metadata indicates no failure: "\"failed\": false".


### Evaluation 2 (from scienceagentbench_hal_generalist_agent_o4mini20250416_low_1746044336_UPLOAD)
- **Grade**: 1.00 (1.0 = IFE detected, 0.0 = no IFE)
- **Explanation**: existence_reasoning: The evaluation runtime used for executing the submitted solution restricts imports in a way that conflicts with the task requirement to create and save a line plot. Specifically, importing matplotlib (the standard plotting library needed to produce the required PNG) is disallowed by the interpreter used in the run. Additionally, attempts to use PIL via submodule import (PIL.Image) were also blocked. This indicates an execution environment restriction inconsistent with the benchmark task's plotting requirement. | causation_reasoning: The agent's core solution approach (load .npy, average across non-time axes, plot, save PNG) is correct and was even demonstrated to work when executed via an unrestricted bash-run Python script (exit code 0). However, the benchmark's restricted execution environment repeatedly prevented importing matplotlib (and also blocked PIL.Image), making it impossible to generate the required PNG within that environment. Thus the failure is caused by the environment restriction, not by agent capability. | evidence: Repeated environment error: "Code execution failed at line 'import matplotlib.pyplot as plt' due to: InterpreterError: Import of matplotlib.pyplot is not allowed." Also: "InterpreterError: Forbidden access to module: PIL.Image" and "InterpreterError: Forbidden access to module: posixpath" when using os.path. Contrasting successful external execution: "Execution logs: Exit Code: 0" after creating and running a standalone script via bash.


### Evaluation 3 (from scienceagentbench_hal_generalist_agent_gpt4120250414_1745541259_UPLOAD)
- **Grade**: 1.00 (1.0 = IFE detected, 0.0 = no IFE)
- **Explanation**: existence_reasoning: The task intrinsically requires generating and saving a PNG line plot, which in a normal ScienceAgentBench container would be feasible (e.g., via matplotlib or PIL). In this run environment, both common plotting (matplotlib) and image creation (PIL.Image) are explicitly blocked, and even basic file writing via open() is forbidden. These restrictions make it impossible for any agent to satisfy the task requirement to save "pred_results/eeg2eeg_vis_pred.png" from within the provided execution sandbox. | causation_reasoning: The agent's failure to produce the required PNG is directly caused by environment prohibitions: importing matplotlib fails; attempting PIL-based plotting fails; attempting to write outputs to disk via open() fails. With both plotting/image libraries and file I/O blocked, no valid solution can generate and save the requested PNG, so the benchmark task cannot be completed successfully in this environment regardless of agent capability. | evidence: Import blocked: "Code execution failed at line 'import matplotlib.pyplot as plt' due to: InterpreterError: Import of matplotlib.pyplot is not allowed." Image library blocked: "InterpreterError: Forbidden access to module: PIL.Image". File writing blocked: "InterpreterError: Forbidden function evaluation: 'open' is not among the explicitly allowed tools". Task requirement: "Save the line plot to \"pred_results/eeg2eeg_vis_pred.png\"."


### Evaluation 4 (from scienceagentbench_hal_generalist_agent_o4mini20250416_high_1746044352_UPLOAD)
- **Grade**: 1.00 (1.0 = IFE detected, 0.0 = no IFE)
- **Explanation**: existence_reasoning: The task explicitly requires generating and saving a line plot (typically via matplotlib), but the execution environment used for the run blocks importing matplotlib.pyplot, and additionally blocks common filesystem utilities indirectly via os.path (posixpath) and even PIL.Image in later attempts. These restrictions constitute an execution-environment defect relative to the task requirements, because producing a PNG line plot is central to the task and standard plotting/image libraries are unusable in the provided runtime. | causation_reasoning: The agent repeatedly attempted the straightforward correct solution with matplotlib and failed solely due to environment import restrictions. The agent then attempted an alternative rendering approach using PIL, which also failed due to environment restriction on PIL.Image. Since both the canonical plotting library (matplotlib) and the fallback image library (PIL.Image) are blocked, no agent can generate and save the required PNG within this environment, so the defect directly caused the failure. | evidence: Environment blocks matplotlib: "Code execution failed at line 'import matplotlib.pyplot as plt' due to: InterpreterError: Import of matplotlib.pyplot is not allowed." (call_2/call_7/call_9/call_10/call_13/call_14/call_15/call_17/call_18)
Environment blocks os.path usage: "InterpreterError: Forbidden access to module: posixpath" at os.path.join and os.path.exists (call_4, call_5).
Environment blocks PIL.Image: "InterpreterError: Forbidden access to module: PIL.Image" (call_12).


### Judge Verdict

**Final Grade**: 1.0
**Satisfies Rubric (has IFE)**: True
**Judge Reasoning**: (1) Claimed issue: The task requires generating and saving a PNG plot to a specific path, but the execution sandbox forbids key capabilities: importing matplotlib.pyplot, importing PIL.Image, and (in at least one report) even using open() for file writing; additionally, posixpath (used by os.path) is blocked. (2) Why I accept it: Multiple independent runs show the same hard interpreter errors on standard plotting/image modules. If both matplotlib and PIL are disallowed, producing a PNG in-Python is effectively impossible in a normal “scientific coding” setting; and if open() is also forbidden, even writing a PNG by bytes is blocked. This is not a mere missing dependency—it's an explicit prohibition by the harness. (3) Alternatives considered: Could an agent work around by using another allowed library (e.g., plotly, seaborn, imageio, cairo, pure-Python PNG writer) or by calling out to system tools? The evidence suggests broad module restrictions (including posixpath) and explicit file I/O/tooling bans; at least one evaluation explicitly states open() is forbidden, which would defeat even a pure-Python PNG encoder. One run being marked "failed": false does not refute the IFE; it more likely reflects a bookkeeping/eval quirk, and the core impossibility is evidenced by repeated interpreter blocks across other runs. (4) Final determination: Overwhelming evidence the environment forbids the essential operations needed to satisfy the task’s required artifact (saving a PNG). This is a benchmark/environment formation defect, not an agent failure.

## BEGIN - SYSTEMATIC APPROACH

For EACH task:

1. **Read the benchmark code** to understand evaluation pipeline
2. **Load the specific task** from HuggingFace dataset
3. **Analyze ALL error messages** from model execution logs
4. **Check EACH item** in the error analysis checklist above
5. **Cross-reference with other models** - same error = likely IFE
6. **Create fix OR document why no fix needed**
7. **Verify fix doesn't nerf the scientific problem**

After processing all tasks:
8. **Update fix runner script** if new fix types were used
9. **Test that fixes can be applied** without errors

Remember: Make evaluation FAIR, not EASY. Be THOROUGH in diagnosis.
Scientific rigor must be preserved - we fix infrastructure, not science.
