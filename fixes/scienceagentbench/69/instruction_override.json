    "For the UMAP visualization, use a legend (positioned outside the plot) to show cell type labels rather than placing text labels directly on the scatter points.",
    "Use scanpy's plotting functions (e.g., sc.pl.umap) which automatically create clean legends.",
    "Ensure the plot is not cluttered - use appropriate figure size and point sizes for clarity."

  "additional_context": "The visualization should be clean and professional, with colors clearly distinguishable and a readable legend."
