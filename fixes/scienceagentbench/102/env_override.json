  "notes": "MODNet is a materials science ML package that requires pymatgen (for crystal structures) and matminer (for featurization). The Docker harness currently has NO special handling for MODNet unlike deepchem/scanpy. This env_override ensures explicit installation. The pickled training data contains MODNet-specific objects that cannot be deserialized without modnet installed."
