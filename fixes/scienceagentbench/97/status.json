  "fix_description": "instruction_override tells agent to include proper import statements for CGCNNModel; this triggers pipreqs detection and DGL post-install hook",
  "notes": "Docker base image has Python 3.10, TensorFlow 2.17 pre-installed. CGCNN requires DGL which is only installed if deepchem is detected by pipreqs."
