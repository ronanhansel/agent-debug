Let me provide a summary:\n\n## Summary\n\nI've analyzed and created fixes for all 5 ScienceAgentBench tasks (39, 43, 44, 52, 55). Here's what was done:\n\n### Root Cause Analysis\nAll 5 tasks share the same fundamental issue: **Sandbox Import Restrictions**\n\nThe `hal_generalist_agent` uses a `CodeAgent` with a restricted `AUTHORIZED_IMPORTS` list that doesn't include the specialized scientific packages required by these tasks:\n\n| Task | Required Library | Purpose |\n|------|-----------------|---------|\n| 39 | ProLIF/MDAnalysis | Protein-protein interaction fingerprints |\n| 43 | NeuroKit2/MNE | EOG signal analysis (eye blink detection) |\n| 44 | BioPsyKit | Sleep IMU data processing |\n| 52 | DeepChem/RDKit | Graph neural networks for QSAR |\n| 55 | Iris (scitools-iris) | Oceanographic NetCDF data analysis |\n\n### Fixes Created\nFor each task, I created:\n1. **`env_override.json`** - Documents required packages with justification\n2. **`README.md`** - Detailed root cause analysis, evidence, and fix rationale\n\n### Key Findings\n1. **Task 43** has a **hidden transitive dependency**: `neurokit2.eog_findpeaks()` internally calls `_eog_findpeaks_mne()` which requires `mne` (not documented in task)\n\n2. **Task 55** shows a residual issue: even with Iris installed, the \"empty CubeList\" error suggests the generated code has bugs in constraint logic - this may be an agent capability issue after the sandbox barrier is removed\n\n3. The Docker evaluation environment already has special handling for some packages (`iris` → `scitools-iris`, `deepchem` → adds `dgl`), but agents can't leverage this because they can't test imports during code development\n\n### Solution Path\nTo actually apply these fixes, one of the following is needed:\n1. **Expand `AUTHORIZED_IMPORTS`** in `hal_generalist_agent/main.py` to include scientific packages\n2. **Create per-task agent configurations** that inject packages into `additional_authorized_imports`\n3. **Modify the fix runner script** to dynamically add imports based on `env_override.json`\n\nThe fixes I created document the requirements - applying them requires changes to the agent infrastructure.","session_id":"7dd87235-f7db-4a9d-b7b9-ab2802f679ab","total_cost_usd":3.1922694999999983,"usage":{"input_tokens":971,"cache_creation_input_tokens":118462,"cache_read_input_tokens":4037334,"output_tokens":16685,"server_tool_use":{"web_search_requests":0,"web_fetch_requests":0},"service_tier":"standard","cache_creation":{"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":118462}},"modelUsage":{"claude-opus-4-5-20251101":{"inputTokens":971,"outputTokens":16685,"cacheReadInputTokens":4037334,"cacheCreationInputTokens":118462,"webSearchRequests":0,"costUSD":3.1810344999999987,"contextWindow":200000,"maxOutputTokens":64000},"claude-haiku-4-5-20251001":{"inputTokens":8245,"outputTokens":598,"cacheReadInputTokens":0,"cacheCreationInputTokens":0,"webSearchRequests":0,"costUSD":0.011234999999999998,"contextWindow":200000,"maxOutputTokens":64000}},"permission_denials":[],"uuid":"38abd449-bcf7-46ea-9ad8-3f8bb930b64c"}
