  "notes": "Task requires Iris library (scitools-iris) for NetCDF oceanographic data analysis. The sandbox blocks 'import iris' and 'import matplotlib.pyplot'. Docker has special handling to map 'iris' to 'scitools-iris'. The 'empty CubeList' error suggests the agent's code has issues loading/filtering the data, but root cause is inability to test imports during development."
