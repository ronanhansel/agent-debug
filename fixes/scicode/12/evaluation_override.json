  "preamble": "# Compatibility shim for scipy.integrate.simps (deprecated in SciPy 1.14, removed in 1.17)\nimport scipy.integrate\nif not hasattr(scipy.integrate, 'simps'):\n    scipy.integrate.simps = scipy.integrate.simpson\n",
  "apply_to_all_steps": true,
  "notes": "The benchmark instructions say to use 'Simpson's rule' for integration. In modern SciPy (1.14+), simps was deprecated and in 1.17+ it was removed, replaced by simpson. This shim ensures backward compatibility for solutions that use the documented simps function."
